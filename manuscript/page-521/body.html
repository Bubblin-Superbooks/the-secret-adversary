We&rsquo;re no nearer to finding Tuppence, and next Sunday is the 29th!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; said Julius thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost forgotten about the 29th. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So have I. At least, I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten about the 29th, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence. But to-day&rsquo;s the 23rd, and time&rsquo;s getting short. If we&rsquo;re ever going to get hold of her at all, we must do it before the 29th&mdash;her life won&rsquo;t be worth an hour&rsquo;s purchase afterwards. The hostage game will be played out by then.</p></div> </div>
