<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept knocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt Jane, way out West? It worried me some. You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never make good. He wasn&rsquo;t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her down. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they&rsquo;d left a daughter&mdash;Jane&mdash;who&rsquo;d been torpedoed in the <em>Lusitania</em> on her way to Paris. She was saved all right, but they didn&rsquo;t seem able to hear of her over this side. I guessed they weren&rsquo;t hustling any, so I thought I&rsquo;d come along over, and speed things up. I phoned Scotland Yard and the Admiralty first thing. The Admiralty rather choked me off, but Scotland Yard were very civil&mdash;said they would make inquiries, even sent a man round this morning to get her photograph. I&rsquo;m off to Paris to-morrow, just to see what the Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro hustling them, they ought to get busy!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
