I have information that the big coup was planned for early in the new year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action which will deal effectually with the strike menace. They&rsquo;ll get wind of it soon, if they haven&rsquo;t already, and it&rsquo;s possible that that may bring things to a head. I hope it will myself. The less time they have to mature their plans the better. I&rsquo;m just warning you that you haven&rsquo;t much time before you, and that you needn&rsquo;t be cast down if you fail. It&rsquo;s not an easy proposition anyway. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
