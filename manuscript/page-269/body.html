<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">curious&mdash;really very curious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded Tuppence.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I happened to meet him this morning. I&rsquo;ve known him slightly on and off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street. Staying at the <em>MÃ©tropole</em>, he told me.&rdquo; He turned to Julius. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he tell you he was coming up to town?&rdquo;</p><p>Julius shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; mused Sir James. &ldquo;You did not mention his name this afternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for further information with my card as introduction.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m a mutt,&rdquo; said Julius with unusual humility. &ldquo;I ought to have thought of the false name stunt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?&rdquo; cried Tuppence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure anyone else would have been killed right off.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
