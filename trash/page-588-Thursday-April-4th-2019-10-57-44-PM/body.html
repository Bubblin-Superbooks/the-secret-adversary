And that&rsquo;s plumb impossible! No, by gum, I&rsquo;ve got it! It was her I saw talking to Whittington at that nursing home in Bournemouth. She wasn&rsquo;t a patient there! She was a nurse!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said Tommy angrily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s probably been in with them from the start. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she stole those papers from Danvers to begin with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m darned if she did!&rdquo; shouted Julius. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my cousin, and as patriotic a girl as ever stepped.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
