<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the girl was really Whittington&rsquo;s niece, she might be too cute to fall into the trap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did was to write out a wire to Beresford saying where I was, and that I was laid up with a sprained foot, and telling him to come down if he wasn&rsquo;t busy. I had to be guarded in what I said. However, I didn&rsquo;t hear from him, and my foot soon got all right. It was only ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I said good-bye to the little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if he heard from Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss Tuppence, you&rsquo;re looking mighty pale!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
