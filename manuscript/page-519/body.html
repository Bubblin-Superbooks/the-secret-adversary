We&rsquo;ll make that pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here until we find her. Somebody must have seen her.&rdquo;</p><p>Forthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately and together, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to Tuppence&rsquo;s description had been seen in the vicinity. They were baffled&mdash;but not discouraged. Finally they altered their tactics. Tuppence had certainly not remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed to her having been overcome and carried away in a car. They renewed inquiries. Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House that day? Again they met with no success.</p></div> </div>
