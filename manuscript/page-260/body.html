It was about thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of got it into my head that, if I climbed up that tree, I&rsquo;d very likely be able to see into that room. Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington should be in that room rather than in any other&mdash;less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs. But I guess I&rsquo;d got the hump from standing so long in the rain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I started up.</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the boughs mighty slippery, and it was all I could do to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I managed it, until at last there I was level with the window.</p></div> </div>
