Somehow, they seemed bound up with Sir James&rsquo;s enigmatical words....</p><p>Suddenly she gave a great start&mdash;the colour faded out of her face. Her eyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils dilated.</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Impossible! I must be going mad even to think of such a thing....&rdquo;</p><p>Monstrous&mdash;yet it explained everything....</p><p>After a moment&rsquo;s reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing each word as she did so.
