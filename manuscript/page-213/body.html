Well, I guess I&rsquo;d better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress as a chauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you could make some kind of signal, and I&rsquo;d trail him. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Splendid, but he mightn&rsquo;t come for weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to chance that. I&rsquo;m glad you like the plan.&rdquo; He rose.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To buy the car, of course,&rdquo; replied Julius, surprised. &ldquo;What make do you like? I guess you&rsquo;ll do some riding in it before we&rsquo;ve finished.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Tuppence faintly, &ldquo;I <em>like</em> Rolls-Royces, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Julius. &ldquo;What you say goes.
