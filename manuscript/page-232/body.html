<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>TUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties. The daughters of the archdeacon were well grounded in household tasks. They were also experts in training a &ldquo;raw girl,&rdquo; the inevitable result being that the raw girl, once trained, departed elsewhere where her newly acquired knowledge commanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacon&rsquo;s meagre purse allowed.</p><p>Tuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient. Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly terror of her mistress. The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some hold over her. For the rest, she cooked like a chef, as Tuppence had an opportunity of judging that evening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a guest to dinner, and Tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished table for two. She was a little exercised in her own mind as to this visitor.</p></div> </div>
