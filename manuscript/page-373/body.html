And then she looks up at the clock, and &lsquo;Hurry up,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;Tell them to get me a taxi,&rsquo; and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in front of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I was, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard her call out what I told you.&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">The small boy stopped and replenished his lungs.</p></div> </div>
