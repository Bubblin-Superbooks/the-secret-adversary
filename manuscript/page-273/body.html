<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I forgot. Of course you don&rsquo;t know all that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite expression. &ldquo;Put me wise.&rdquo;</p><p>Tuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days. Julius&rsquo;s astonishment and admiration were unbounded.</p><p>&ldquo;Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to death!&rdquo; Then he added seriously: &ldquo;But say now, I don&rsquo;t like it, Miss Tuppence, I sure don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re just as plucky as they make &lsquo;em, but I wish you&rsquo;d keep right out of this. These crooks we&rsquo;re up against would as soon croak a girl as a man any day.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
