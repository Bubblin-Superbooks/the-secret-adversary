You heard me say yesterday that I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me that I have now proved I have some wits to live by! I admit I have knowledge of a certain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snarled Whittington.</p><p>&ldquo;You insist on misjudging me,&rdquo; said Tuppence, and sighed gently.</p><p>&ldquo;As I said once before,&rdquo; said Whittington angrily, &ldquo;quit fooling, and come to the point. You can&rsquo;t play the innocent with me. You know a great deal more than you&rsquo;re willing to admit.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
