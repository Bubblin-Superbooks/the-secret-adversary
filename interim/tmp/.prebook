    "p": "IT was 2 p.m. on the afternoon of May 7, 1915. The <em>Lusitania</em> had been struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while the boats were being launched with all possible speed. The women and children were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children closely to their breasts. One girl stood alone, slightly apart from the rest. She was quite young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem afraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead."
  },
  "2": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3": {
    "p": "A man&rsquo;s voice beside her made her start and turn. She had noticed the speaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers. There had been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance."
  },
  "4": {
    "p": "She noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death!"
  },
  "5": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Her grave eyes met his inquiringly."

  "6": {
    "p": "He stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution."

    "p": "&ldquo;It must be!&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it is the only way.&rdquo; Then aloud he said abruptly: &ldquo;You are an American?&rdquo;"

  "8": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;"
  },
  "9": {
    "p": "&ldquo;A patriotic one?&rdquo;"

  },
  "12": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be offended. You wouldn&rsquo;t be if you knew how much there was at stake. But I&rsquo;ve got to trust some one&mdash;and it must be a woman.&rdquo;"

  "13": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;"
  },
  "14": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Because of &lsquo;women and children first.&rsquo;&rdquo; He looked round and lowered his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m carrying papers&mdash;vitally important papers. They may make all the difference to the Allies in the war. You understand? These papers have <em>got</em> to be saved! They&rsquo;ve more chance with you than with me. Will you take them?&rdquo;"
  },
  "15": {
    "p": "The girl held out her hand."
  },
  "16": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Wait&mdash;I must warn you. There may be a risk&mdash;if I&rsquo;ve been followed. I don&rsquo;t think I have, but one never knows. If so, there will be danger. Have you the nerve to go through with it?&rdquo;"

  "17": {
    "p": "The girl smiled."

  "18": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go through with it all right. And I&rsquo;m real proud to be chosen! What am I to do with them afterwards?&rdquo;"

  "19": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Watch the newspapers! I&rsquo;ll advertise in the personal column of the <em>Times</em>, beginning &lsquo;Shipmate.&rsquo; At the end of three days if there&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m down and out. Then take the packet to the American Embassy, and deliver it into the Ambassador&rsquo;s own hands. Is that clear?&rdquo;"
  },
  "20": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Quite clear.&rdquo;"
  },
  "21": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Then be ready&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to say good-bye.&rdquo; He took her hand in his. &ldquo;Good-bye. Good luck to you,&rdquo; he said in a louder tone."

    "p": "Her hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm."

  },

    "p": "&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; interrupted Tuppence, &ldquo;there is nothing I do <em>not</em> know about the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons&rsquo;, and we will each of us pay for our own. That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; And Tuppence led the way upstairs."
  },
  "47": {
    "p": "The place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table, catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so."
  },
  "48": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And&mdash;do you know, she sat down and <em>cried</em> when I told her she couldn&rsquo;t have the flat after all.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was simply a <em>bargain</em>, my dear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "49": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Funny scraps one does overhear,&rdquo; murmured Tommy. &ldquo;I passed two Johnnies in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn. Did you ever hear such a name?&rdquo;"
  },
  "50": {
    "p": "But at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels, and Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats."
  },
  "51": {
    "p": "Tommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast."
  },
  "52": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,&rdquo; she added severely."
  },
  "53": {
    "p": "Tommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly ugly&mdash;nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether."
  },
  "54": {
    "p": "They were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there. Tuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black brows. She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair, and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles. Her appearance presented a valiant attempt at smartness."
  },
  "55": {
    "p": "The tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of meditation, poured it out."
  },
  "56": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get up-to-date. Remember, I haven&rsquo;t seen you since that time in hospital in 1916.&rdquo;"
  },
  "57": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast. &ldquo;Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up to London, where she entered an officers&rsquo; hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes. Fourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month: Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters! Eighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven&rsquo;s egg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important matters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the mighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow, Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!&rdquo;"
  },
  "58": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What blighter was that?&rdquo; inquired Tommy. &ldquo;Perfectly sickening the way those brass hats drove from the War Office to the <em>Savoy</em>, and from the <em>Savoy</em> to the War Office!&rdquo;"
  },
  "59": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten his name now,&rdquo; confessed Tuppence. &ldquo;To resume, that was in a way the apex of my career. I next entered a Government office. We had several very enjoyable tea parties. I had intended to become a land girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off my career&mdash;but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the true limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at last. Since then I&rsquo;ve been looking for a job. Now then&mdash;your turn.&rdquo;"
  },
  "60": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not so much promotion in mine,&rdquo; said Tommy regretfully, &ldquo;and a great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time, and went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I told you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months I&rsquo;ve been job hunting! There aren&rsquo;t any jobs! And, if there were, they wouldn&rsquo;t give &lsquo;em to me. What good am I? What do I know about business? Nothing.&rdquo;"
  },
  "61": {
    "p": "Tuppence nodded gloomily."

  "62": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What about the colonies?&rdquo; she suggested."

  },
  "65": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Rich relations?&rdquo;"
  },
  "66": {
    "p": "Again Tommy shook his head."

  "67": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?&rdquo;"
  },
  "68": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an old uncle who&rsquo;s more or less rolling, but he&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;"
  },
  "69": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;"
  },
  "70": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.&rdquo;"
  },
  "71": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I think I remember hearing about it,&rdquo; said Tuppence slowly. &ldquo;You refused because of your mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "72": {
    "p": "Tommy flushed."
  },
  "73": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was all she had. Old boy hated her&mdash;wanted to get me away from her. Just a bit of spite.&rdquo;"
  },
  "74": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s dead, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said Tuppence gently."
  },
  "75": {
    "p": "Tommy nodded."
  },
  "76": {
    "p": "Tuppence&rsquo;s large grey eyes looked misty."
  },
  "77": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "78": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; said Tommy hastily. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s my position. I&rsquo;m just about desperate.&rdquo;"
  },
  "79": {
    "p": "&ldquo;So am I! I&rsquo;ve hung out as long as I could. I&rsquo;ve touted round. I&rsquo;ve answered advertisements. I&rsquo;ve tried every mortal blessed thing. I&rsquo;ve screwed and saved and pinched! But it&rsquo;s no good. I shall have to go home!&rdquo;"
  },
  "80": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to?&rdquo;"
  },
  "81": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t want to! What&rsquo;s the good of being sentimental? Father&rsquo;s a dear&mdash;I&rsquo;m awfully fond of him&mdash;but you&rsquo;ve no idea how I worry him! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and smoking are immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to him! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see, there are seven of us at home. It&rsquo;s awful! All housework and mothers&rsquo; meetings! I have always been the changeling. I don&rsquo;t want to go back, but&mdash;oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?&rdquo;"
  },
  "82": {
    "p": "Tommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst out:"
  },
  "83": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I dare say it&rsquo;s mercenary of me, but there it is!&rdquo;"
  },
  "84": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Tommy with feeling."
  },
  "85": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,&rdquo; continued Tuppence. &ldquo;There are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make it. First is ruled out. I haven&rsquo;t got any rich elderly relatives. Any relatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old ladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case they should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them has ever asked me my name&mdash;and quite a lot never said &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
  },
  "86": {
    "p": "There was a pause."
  },
  "87": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; resumed Tuppence, &ldquo;marriage is my best chance. I made up my mind to marry money when I was quite young. Any thinking girl would! I&rsquo;m not sentimental, you know.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;Come now, you can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sentimental,&rdquo; she added sharply."
  },
  "88": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; agreed Tommy hastily. &ldquo;No one would ever think of sentiment in connection with you.&rdquo;"
  },
  "89": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very polite,&rdquo; replied Tuppence. &ldquo;But I dare say you mean it all right. Well, there it is! I&rsquo;m ready and willing&mdash;but I never meet any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.&rdquo;"
  },
  "90": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What about the general?&rdquo; inquired Tommy."
  },
  "91": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,&rdquo; explained Tuppence. &ldquo;No, there it is! Now <em>you</em> could marry a rich girl.&rdquo;"
  },
  "92": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m like you. I don&rsquo;t know any.&rdquo;"
  },
  "93": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a man in a fur coat come out of the <em>Ritz</em> I can&rsquo;t rush up to him and say: &lsquo;Look here, you&rsquo;re rich. I&rsquo;d like to know you.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
  },
  "94": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?&rdquo;"
  },
  "95": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or something like that. If she thinks you want to know her she&rsquo;s flattered, and will manage it for you somehow.&rdquo;"
  },
  "96": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You overrate my manly charms,&rdquo; murmured Tommy."
  },
  "97": {
    "p": "&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; proceeded Tuppence, &ldquo;my millionaire would probably run for his life! No&mdash;marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains&mdash;to <em>make</em> money!&rdquo;"
  },
  "98": {
    "p": "&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried that, and failed,&rdquo; Tommy reminded her."
  },
  "99": {
    "p": "&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the unorthodox. Tommy, let&rsquo;s be adventurers!&rdquo;"
  },
  "100": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Tommy cheerfully. &ldquo;How do we begin?&rdquo;"
  },
  "101": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might hire us to commit crimes for them.&rdquo;"
  },
  "102": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Delightful,&rdquo; commented Tommy. &ldquo;Especially coming from a clergyman&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;"
  },
  "103": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The moral guilt,&rdquo; Tuppence pointed out, &ldquo;would be theirs&mdash;not mine. You must admit that there&rsquo;s a difference between stealing a diamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "104": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be the least difference if you were caught!&rdquo;"
  },
  "105": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Perhaps not. But I shouldn&rsquo;t be caught. I&rsquo;m so clever.&rdquo;"
  },
  "106": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Modesty always was your besetting sin,&rdquo; remarked Tommy."
  },
  "107": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business partnership?&rdquo;"
  },
  "108": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?&rdquo;"
  },
  "109": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That was only an illustration. Let&rsquo;s have a&mdash;what do you call it in book-keeping?&rdquo;"
  },
  "110": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Never did any.&rdquo;"
  },
  "111": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I have&mdash;but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit entries on the debit side, and vice versa&mdash;so they fired me out. Oh, I know&mdash;a joint venture! It struck me as such a romantic phrase to come across in the middle of musty old figures. It&rsquo;s got an Elizabethan flavour about it&mdash;makes one think of galleons and doubloons. A joint venture!&rdquo;"
  },
  "112": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that your idea, Tuppence?&rdquo;"
  },
  "113": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "114": {
    "p": "&ldquo;How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employers?&rdquo;"
  },
  "115": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Advertisement,&rdquo; replied Tuppence promptly. &ldquo;Have you got a bit of paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpins and powder-puffs.&rdquo;"
  },
  "116": {
    "p": "Tommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began writing busily."

  },
  "118": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;"
  },
  "119": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might adopt you, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at all.&rdquo;"
  },
  "120": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be adopted.&rdquo;"
  },
  "121": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging you! The papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now listen&mdash;how&rsquo;s this? &lsquo;Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.&rsquo; (We might as well make that clear from the start.) Then we might add: &lsquo;No reasonable offer refused&rsquo;&mdash;like flats and furniture.&rdquo;"
  },
  "122": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty <em>un</em>reasonable one!&rdquo;"
  },
  "123": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Tommy! You&rsquo;re a genius! That&rsquo;s ever so much more chic. &lsquo;No unreasonable offer refused&mdash;if pay is good.&rsquo; How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;"
  },
  "124": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mention pay again. It looks rather eager.&rdquo;"
  },
  "125": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right. Now I&rsquo;ll read it straight through. &lsquo;Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer refused.&rsquo; How would that strike you if you read it?&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning &lsquo;Petunia&rsquo; and signed &lsquo;Best Boy.&rsquo;&rdquo; She tore out the leaf and handed it to Tommy. &ldquo;There you are. <em>Times</em>, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so. I expect it will be about five shillings. Here&rsquo;s half a crown for my share.&rdquo;"

  "128": {
    "p": "Tommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a deeper red."

  },

    "p": "&ldquo;Tommy, you&rsquo;re a sport! I knew you would be! Let&rsquo;s drink to success.&rdquo; She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups."

There&rsquo;s something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I don&rsquo;t like at all. But, on the other hand, I&rsquo;m not the least bit afraid of you.

    "p": "It was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable resemblance to hospital plates!"

  "173": {
    "p": "It wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were situated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence decided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On the stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building. The Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but Tuppence chose to walk up."

  },
  "203": {
    "p": "&ldquo;On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American. Details about your past life in England might be more difficult to sustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly better. Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "204": {
    "p": "&ldquo;One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for granted.&rdquo;"
  },

    "p": "Whittington looked surprised."
  },

  },
  "207": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Tuppence. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. The terms are almost too liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth that amount of money to you.&rdquo;"
  },
  "208": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Whittington softly. &ldquo;Well, I will tell you. I could doubtless obtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to sustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions.&rdquo;"

  },

    "p": "&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s off!&rdquo; Tuppence rose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s both or neither. Sorry&mdash;but that&rsquo;s how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.&rdquo;"
  },

    "p": "&ldquo;Wait a minute. Let us see if something can&rsquo;t be managed. Sit down again, Miss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused interrogatively."
  },

    "p": "Tuppence&rsquo;s conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her head."
  },
  "217": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Jane Finn,&rdquo; she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the effect of those two simple words."
  },
  "218": {
    "p": "All the geniality had faded out of Whittington&rsquo;s face. It was purple with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed savagely:"
  },
  "219": {
    "p": "&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your little game, is it?&rdquo;"
  },
  "220": {
    "p": "Tuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally quick-witted, and felt it imperative to &ldquo;keep her end up&rdquo; as she phrased it."
  },
  "221": {
    "p": "Whittington went on:"
  },
  "222": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse? Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that it, eh?&rdquo; He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face. He eyed her keenly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been blabbing? Rita?&rdquo;"
  },
  "223": {
    "p": "Tuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she could sustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of not dragging an unknown Rita into it."
  },
  "224": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied with perfect truth. &ldquo;Rita knows nothing about me.&rdquo;"
  },
  "225": {

  },
  "226": {
    "p": "&ldquo;How much do you know?&rdquo; he shot out."
  },
  "227": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Very little indeed,&rdquo; answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that Whittington&rsquo;s uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind."
  },
  "228": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; snarled Whittington, &ldquo;you knew enough to come in here and plump out that name.&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;It might be my own name,&rdquo; Tuppence pointed out."
  },
  "230": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely, isn&rsquo;t it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?&rdquo;"
  },
  "231": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,&rdquo; continued Tuppence, intoxicated with the success of truthfulness."
  },
  "232": {
    "p": "Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang."
  },
  "233": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?&rdquo;"
  },
  "234": {
    "p": "The last five words took Tuppence&rsquo;s fancy mightily, especially after a meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Her present part was of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order, but she did not deny its possibilities. She sat up and smiled with the air of one who has the situation thoroughly well in hand."
  },
  "235": {
    "p": "&ldquo;My dear Mr. Whittington,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us by all means lay our cards upon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me say yesterday that I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me that I have now proved I have some wits to live by! I admit I have knowledge of a certain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends there.&rdquo;"
  },
  "236": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snarled Whittington."
  },
  "237": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You insist on misjudging me,&rdquo; said Tuppence, and sighed gently."
  },
  "238": {
    "p": "&ldquo;As I said once before,&rdquo; said Whittington angrily, &ldquo;quit fooling, and come to the point. You can&rsquo;t play the innocent with me. You know a great deal more than you&rsquo;re willing to admit.&rdquo;"
  },
  "239": {
    "p": "Tuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then said softly:"

  "240": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.&rdquo;"
  },
  "241": {
    "p": "&ldquo;So we come to the usual question&mdash;how much?&rdquo;"
  },
  "242": {
    "p": "Tuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington with complete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken his suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain."
  },
  "243": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the matter later?&rdquo;"
  },
  "244": {
    "p": "Whittington gave her an ugly glance."

  },
  "250": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You&rsquo;re about the limit, that&rsquo;s what you are,&rdquo; growled Whittington, with a sort of unwilling admiration. &ldquo;You took me in all right. Thought you were quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose.&rdquo;"

  "251": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; moralized Tuppence, &ldquo;is full of surprises.&rdquo;"
  },
  "252": {

    "p": "&ldquo;And now tell me,&rdquo; said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up curiosity any longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many <em>hors d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</em> of Tuppence&rsquo;s dreams."
  },
  "298": {
    "p": "Miss Cowley told him."
  },
  "299": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And the curious part of it is,&rdquo; she ended, &ldquo;that I really did invent the name of Jane Finn! I didn&rsquo;t want to give my own because of poor father&mdash;in case I should get mixed up in anything shady.&rdquo;"
  },
  "300": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Tommy slowly. &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t invent it.&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;What?&rdquo;"
  },
  "302": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No. <em>I</em> told it to you. Don&rsquo;t you remember, I said yesterday I&rsquo;d overheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn? That&rsquo;s what brought the name into your mind so pat.&rdquo;"
  },
  "303": {
    "p": "&ldquo;So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Tuppence tailed off into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. &ldquo;Tommy!&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;"

  },
  "308": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Whittington! What was the other man like?&rdquo;"
  },
  "309": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember. I didn&rsquo;t notice him particularly. It was really the outlandish name that caught my attention.&rdquo;"
  },
  "310": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And people say that coincidences don&rsquo;t happen!&rdquo; Tuppence tackled her Pêche Melba happily."
  },

  "312": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?&rdquo;"
  },
  "313": {
    "p": "&ldquo;More money,&rdquo; replied his companion."
  },
  "314": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I know that. You&rsquo;ve only got one idea in your head. What I mean is, what about the next step? How are you going to keep the game up?&rdquo;"
  },
  "315": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Tuppence laid down her spoon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Tommy, it is a bit of a poser.&rdquo;"
  },
  "316": {
    "p": "&ldquo;After all, you know, you can&rsquo;t bluff him forever. You&rsquo;re sure to slip up sooner or later. And, anyway, I&rsquo;m not at all sure that it isn&rsquo;t actionable&mdash;blackmail, you know.&rdquo;"
  },
  "317": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Nonsense. Blackmail is saying you&rsquo;ll tell unless you are given money. Now, there&rsquo;s nothing I could tell, because I don&rsquo;t really know anything.&rdquo;"
  },
  "318": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; said Tommy doubtfully. &ldquo;Well, anyway, what <em>are</em> we going to do? Whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning, but next time he&rsquo;ll want to know something more before he parts with his money. He&rsquo;ll want to know how much <em>you</em> know, and where you got your information from, and a lot of other things that you can&rsquo;t cope with. What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;"
  },
  "319": {
    "p": "Tuppence frowned severely."

  },
  "321": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that matter, but I flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours. Two coffees.&rdquo; (This was to the waiter.) &ldquo;One Turkish, one French.&rdquo;"
  },
  "322": {
    "p": "Tuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed Tommy when he spoke to her."

    "p": "&ldquo;Be quiet. I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;"
  },
  "324": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Shades of Pelmanism!&rdquo; said Tommy, and relapsed into silence."
  },
  "325": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Tuppence at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan. Obviously what we&rsquo;ve got to do is to find out more about it all.&rdquo;"
  },
  "326": {
    "p": "Tommy applauded."
  },
  "327": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must discover where he lives, what he does&mdash;sleuth him, in fact! Now I can&rsquo;t do it, because he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like another.&rdquo;"

  },
  "329": {
    "p": "&ldquo;My plan is this,&rdquo; Tuppence went on calmly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go alone to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I don&rsquo;t get any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.&rdquo;"
  },
  "330": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Or even longer!&rdquo;"
  },
  "331": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hang about outside. When I come out I shan&rsquo;t speak to you in case he&rsquo;s watching. But I&rsquo;ll take up my stand somewhere near, and when he comes out of the building I&rsquo;ll drop a handkerchief or something, and off you go!&rdquo;"
  },
  "332": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Off I go where?&rdquo;"
  },
  "333": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?&rdquo;"
  },
  "334": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with nothing to do. People will wonder what I&rsquo;m up to.&rdquo;"
  },
  "335": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Not in the city. Every one&rsquo;s in such a hurry. Probably no one will even notice you at all.&rdquo;"
  },
  "336": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the second time you&rsquo;ve made that sort of remark. Never mind, I forgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are you doing this afternoon?&rdquo;"
  },
  "337": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tuppence meditatively. &ldquo;I <em>had</em> thought of hats! Or perhaps silk stockings! Or perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "338": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Hold hard,&rdquo; admonished Tommy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a limit to fifty pounds! But let&rsquo;s do dinner and a show to-night at all events.&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does not concern you. It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of 1915 a certain document came into being. It was the draft of a secret agreement&mdash;treaty&mdash;call it what you like. It was drawn up ready for signature by the various representatives, and drawn up in America&mdash;at that time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special messenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It was hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing would have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually disappointed. Somebody always talks!"

  "441": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Danvers sailed for England on the <em>Lusitania</em>. He carried the precious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that particular voyage that the <em>Lusitania</em> was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing!"
  },
  "442": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself passed it on into another&rsquo;s keeping? There were a few incidents that strengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the torpedo struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. No one actually saw him pass anything to her, but he might have done so. It seems to me quite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl, believing that she, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore."
  },
  "443": {
    "p": "&ldquo;But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers? By later advice from America it seemed likely that Danvers had been closely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl in league with his enemies? Or had she, in her turn, been shadowed and either tricked or forced into handing over the precious packet?"

Her name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the survivors, but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely. Inquiries into her antecedents did little to help us. She was an orphan, and had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small school out West. Her passport had been made out for Paris, where she was going to join the staff of a hospital. She had offered her services voluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been accepted. Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the <em>Lusitania</em>, the staff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving to take up her billet, and at not hearing from her in any way."

No use was made of the draft treaty&mdash;as might very easily have been done&mdash;and we therefore came to the conclusion that Danvers had, after all, destroyed it. The war entered on another phase, the diplomatic aspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never redrafted. Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The disappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost in oblivion.&rdquo;"

That is an extreme possibility, and I do not believe in its likelihood myself, but that document undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot afford to have discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party cry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government at this juncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for British trade, but that is a mere nothing to the <em>real</em> danger.&rdquo;"

He is always spoken of by the unassuming title of &lsquo;Mr. Brown.&rsquo; But one thing is certain, he is the master criminal of this age. He controls a marvellous organization.

It is reported that even his own followers are ignorant of it. Where we have come across his tracks, he has always played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes the chief rôle.

There&rsquo;s something mysterious about this draft treaty that we haven&rsquo;t fathomed yet. We&rsquo;ve been threatened with it&mdash;in plain and unmistakable terms. The Revolutionary element as good as declare that it&rsquo;s in their hands, and that they intend to produce it at a given moment. On the other hand, they are clearly at fault about many of its provisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff on their part, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of absolute denial. I&rsquo;m not so sure. There have been hints, indiscreet allusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one. The position is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating document, but couldn&rsquo;t read it because it was in cipher&mdash;but we know that the draft treaty wasn&rsquo;t in cipher&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t be in the nature of things&mdash;so that won&rsquo;t wash. But there&rsquo;s <em>something</em>. Of course, Jane Finn may be dead for all we know&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t think so.

You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never make good. He wasn&rsquo;t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her down. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they&rsquo;d left a daughter&mdash;Jane&mdash;who&rsquo;d been torpedoed in the <em>Lusitania</em> on her way to Paris. She was saved all right, but they didn&rsquo;t seem able to hear of her over this side. I guessed they weren&rsquo;t hustling any, so I thought I&rsquo;d come along over, and speed things up. I phoned Scotland Yard and the Admiralty first thing. The Admiralty rather choked me off, but Scotland Yard were very civil&mdash;said they would make inquiries, even sent a man round this morning to get her photograph.

  "592": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said Tommy doubtfully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call that much of a clue. You don&rsquo;t know where to look for him, and it&rsquo;s about a thousand to one against your running against him by accident.&rdquo;"
  },
  "593": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; replied Tuppence thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often noticed that once coincidences start happening they go on happening in the most extraordinary way. I dare say it&rsquo;s some natural law that we haven&rsquo;t found out. Still, as you say, we can&rsquo;t rely on that. But there <em>are</em> places in London where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner or later. Piccadilly Circus, for instance. One of my ideas was to take up my stand there every day with a tray of flags.&rdquo;"

  "596": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well. You&rsquo;ve just had a thundering good breakfast. No one&rsquo;s got a better appetite than you have, Tuppence, and by tea-time you&rsquo;d be eating the flags, pins and all. But, honestly, I don&rsquo;t think much of the idea. Whittington mayn&rsquo;t be in London at all.&rdquo;"

His vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them, and by the time he, in his turn, reached the corner the distance between them was sensibly lessened. The small Mayfair streets were comparatively deserted, and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in sight."

  "681": {
    "p": "The sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the technicalities from a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to &ldquo;follow&rdquo; anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual practice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply leapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign&mdash;or its modern equivalent&mdash;and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he would have to run. What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road he might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain matters."

When at length they turned into it, proceeding in an easterly direction, Tommy slightly increased his pace. Little by little he gained upon them. On the crowded pavement there was little chance of his attracting their notice, and he was anxious if possible to catch a word or two of their conversation. In this he was completely foiled; they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices effectually."

There they went up to the first floor, and sat at a small table in the window. It was late, and the place was thinning out. Tommy took a seat at the table next to them, sitting directly behind Whittington in case of recognition. On the other hand, he had a full view of the second man and studied him attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face, and Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was probably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly."

Whittington ordered a substantial lunch for himself and his companion; then, as the waitress withdrew, he moved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly in a low voice. The other man joined in. Listen as he would, Tommy could only catch a word here and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some directions or orders which the big man was impressing on his companion, and with which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree. Whittington addressed the other as Boris."

It was now ten past. Whittington and Boris were walking up and down by the bookstall. He gave one doubtful look at them, then hurried into an adjacent telephone box. He dared not waste time in trying to get hold of Tuppence. In all probability she was still in the neighbourhood of South Audley Mansions. But there remained another ally. He rang up the <em>Ritz</em> and asked for Julius Hersheimmer. There was a click and a buzz. Oh, if only the young American was in his room!

In spite of the carte blanche assured to him, he had not yet acquired the habit of going about with any considerable sum of money on him. The taking of the first-class ticket to Bournemouth had left him with only a few shillings in his pocket. It was to be hoped that Julius would arrive better provided."

    "p": "They reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses there had a sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay. Boris looked round, and Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch. The place was almost deserted. It was a cul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed that way. The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy&rsquo;s imagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the steps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap sharply, with a peculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened promptly, he said a word or two to the doorkeeper, then passed inside. The door was shut to again."
  },
  "723": {
    "p": "It was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought to have done, what any sane man would have done, was to remain patiently where he was and wait for his man to come out again. What he did do was entirely foreign to the sober common sense which was, as a rule, his leading characteristic. Something, as he expressed it, seemed to snap in his brain. Without a moment&rsquo;s pause for reflection he, too, went up the steps, and reproduced as far as he was able the peculiar knock."

  },
  "732": {
    "p": "TAKEN aback though he was by the man&rsquo;s words, Tommy did not hesitate. If audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was to be hoped it would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed into the house and mounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything in the house was filthy beyond words. The grimy paper, of a pattern now indistinguishable, hung in loose festoons from the wall. In every angle was a grey mass of cobweb."
  },
  "733": {
    "p": "Tommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of the staircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back room. Clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to the house and ask for &ldquo;Mr. Brown&rdquo; appeared indeed to be a reasonable and natural proceeding."
  },
  "734": {
    "p": "At the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move. In front of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on either side of it. From the one nearest him on the left came a low murmur of voices. It was this room which he had been directed to enter. But what held his glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right, half concealed by a torn velvet curtain. It was directly opposite the left-handed door and, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view of the upper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a pinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three feet wide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over in his usual slow and steady way, deciding that the mention of &ldquo;Mr. Brown&rdquo; was not a request for an individual, but in all probability a password used by the gang. His lucky use of it had gained him admission. So far he had aroused no suspicion. But he must decide quickly on his next step."
  },
  "735": {
    "p": "Suppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage. Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any rate, some proof of identity. The doorkeeper clearly did not know all the members of the gang by sight, but it might be different upstairs. On the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far, but that there was such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter that room was a colossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part indefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness."
  },
  "736": {
    "p": "A repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and Tommy, his mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and cautiously drew the curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from sight. There were several rents and slits in the ancient material which afforded him a good view. He would watch events, and any time he chose could, after all, join the assembly, modelling his behaviour on that of the new arrival."
  },
  "737": {
    "p": "The man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed tread was quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very dregs of society. The low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw, the bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young man, though he was a type that Scotland Yard would have recognized at a glance."
  },
  "738": {
    "p": "The man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He stopped at the door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal knock. A voice inside called out something, and the man opened the door and passed in, affording Tommy a momentary glimpse of the room inside. He thought there must be about four or five people seated round a long table that took up most of the space, but his attention was caught and held by a tall man with close-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard, who sat at the head of the table with papers in front of him. As the new-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but curiously precise enunciation, which attracted Tommy&rsquo;s notice, he asked:"
  },
  "739": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Your number, comrade?&rdquo;"
  },
  "740": {

    "p": "The door shut again."
  },
  "743": {
    "p": "&ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t a Hun, I&rsquo;m a Dutchman!&rdquo; said Tommy to himself. &ldquo;And running the show darned systematically too&mdash;as they always do. Lucky I didn&rsquo;t roll in. I&rsquo;d have given the wrong number, and there would have been the deuce to pay. No, this is the place for me. Hullo, here&rsquo;s another knock.&rdquo;"
  },
  "744": {
    "p": "This visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last. Tommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly Mr. Brown&rsquo;s organization was a far-reaching concern. The common criminal, the well-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and the efficient German master of the ceremonies! Truly a strange and sinister gathering! Who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?"
  },
  "745": {
    "p": "In this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal knock, the demand for a number, and the reply &ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;"
  },
  "746": {
    "p": "Two knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The first man was quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city clerk. A quiet, intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed. The second was of the working classes, and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man."
  },
  "747": {
    "p": "Three minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance, exquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again, was not unknown to the watcher, though he could not for the moment put a name to it."
  },
  "748": {
    "p": "After his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded that the gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously creeping out from his hiding-place, when another knock sent him scuttling back to cover."
  },
  "749": {
    "p": "This last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast of Tommy before the young man had realized his presence."
  },
  "750": {
    "p": "He was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air. The angle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry, otherwise there was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he passed the recess, he turned his head slowly. The strange light eyes seemed to burn through the curtain; Tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was there and in spite of himself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than the majority of young Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the impression that some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The creature reminded him of a venomous snake."
  },
  "751": {
    "p": "A moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer knocked on the door as all had done, but his reception was very different. The bearded man rose to his feet, and all the others followed suit. The German came forward and shook hands. His heels clicked together."

    "p": "The change in the German&rsquo;s voice was audible as he replied with slight hesitation:"
  },
  "756": {
    "p": "&ldquo;We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be present in person.&rdquo; He stopped, giving a curious impression of having left the sentence unfinished."

  },
  "758": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the dark and trusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that he is among us now....&rdquo; He looked round him again, and again that expression of fear swept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully."

  },
  "760": {
    "p": "&ldquo;So be it. Let us proceed.&rdquo;"

  },
  "763": {
    "p": "In another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels, and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable murmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation he had overheard had stimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by hook or by crook, he must hear more."
  },
  "764": {
    "p": "There was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that the doorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for a minute or two, he put his head round the curtain. The passage was deserted. Tommy bent down and removed his shoes, then, leaving them behind the curtain, he walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet, and kneeling down by the closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack. To his intense annoyance he could distinguish little more; just a chance word here and there if a voice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity still farther."
  },
  "765": {
    "p": "He eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by degrees so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing? He decided that with great care it could be done. Very slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, he moved it round, holding his breath in his excessive care. A little more&mdash;a little more still&mdash;would it never be finished? Ah! at last it would turn no farther."
  },
  "766": {
    "p": "He stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and pressed it ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge. Tommy was annoyed. If he had to use too much force, it would almost certainly creak. He waited until the voices rose a little, then he tried again. Still nothing happened. He increased the pressure. Had the beastly thing stuck? Finally, in desperation, he pushed with all his might. But the door remained firm, and at last the truth dawned upon him. It was locked or bolted on the inside."
  },
  "767": {
    "p": "For a moment or two Tommy&rsquo;s indignation got the better of him."
  },
  "768": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What a dirty trick!&rdquo;"
  },
  "769": {
    "p": "As his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation. Clearly the first thing to be done was to restore the handle to its original position. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside would be almost certain to notice it, so, with the same infinite pains, he reversed his former tactics. All went well, and with a sigh of relief the young man rose to his feet. There was a certain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that made him slow to admit defeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far from abandoning the conflict. He still intended to hear what was going on in the locked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for another."
  },
  "770": {
    "p": "He looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the left was a second door. He slipped silently along to it. He listened for a moment or two, then tried the handle. It yielded, and he slipped inside."
  },
  "771": {
    "p": "The room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like everything else in the house, the furniture was falling to pieces, and the dirt was, if anything, more abundant."
  },
  "772": {
    "p": "But what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a communicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the window. Carefully closing the door into the passage behind him, he stepped across to the other and examined it closely. The bolt was shot across it. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been used for some time. By gently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy managed to draw it back without making too much noise. Then he repeated his former man&oelig;uvres with the handle&mdash;this time with complete success. The door swung open&mdash;a crack, a mere fraction, but enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a velvet <em>portière</em> on the inside of this door which prevented him from seeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount of accuracy."

    "p": "&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;ll be all right!&rdquo; said a new voice, with a transatlantic intonation, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;d like to point out, here and now, that things are getting a mite difficult. There&rsquo;s not the sympathy there was, and a growing disposition to let the Irish settle their own affairs without interference from America.&rdquo;"

  "849": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Look! Do you know what this is?&rdquo; With a dramatic gesture she flung back the left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge. It was extremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of it&mdash;indeed, it would have been fatal for Tuppence&rsquo;s plans, since the badge in question was the device of a local training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early days of the war. Its presence in Tuppence&rsquo;s coat was due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or two before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner of a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert&rsquo;s pocket, and the immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good, and that the fish would rise to the bait."

Many&rsquo;s the time Annie&rsquo;s said to me: &lsquo;Mark my words, Albert, I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the police was to come after her one of these days.&rsquo; Just like that. But she&rsquo;s a stunner to look at, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;"
  },
  "867": {
    "p": "&ldquo;She&rsquo;s some peach,&rdquo; allowed Tuppence carelessly. &ldquo;Finds it useful in her lay-out, you bet. Has she been wearing any of the emeralds, by the way?&rdquo;"

  },
  "879": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Mind you, sonny, not a word of this,&rdquo; said Tuppence suddenly. &ldquo;I guess I oughtn&rsquo;t to have put you wise, but in the States we know a real smart lad when we see one.&rdquo;"
  },
  "880": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not breathe a word,&rdquo; protested Albert eagerly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there anything I could do? A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;Some lad!&rdquo; commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval. &ldquo;You might say that the young woman could come in right away. You let me know, and if it&rsquo;s O.K. I&rsquo;ll be round to-morrow at eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;"

  },
  "895": {
    "p": "But there was no time to be lost. She went straight back to the <em>Ritz</em> and wrote a few brief words to Mr. Carter. Having dispatched this, and Tommy not having yet returned&mdash;which did not surprise her&mdash;she started off on a shopping expedition which, with an interval for tea and assorted creamy cakes, occupied her until well after six o&rsquo;clock, and she returned to the hotel jaded, but satisfied with her purchases. Starting with a cheap clothing store, and passing through one or two second-hand establishments, she had finished the day at a well-known hairdresser&rsquo;s. Now, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she unwrapped that final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled contentedly at her reflection in the glass. With an actress&rsquo;s pencil she had slightly altered the line of her eyebrows, and that, taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth of fair hair above, so changed her appearance that she felt confident that even if she came face to face with Whittington he would not recognize her. She would wear elevators in her shoes, and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise. From hospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of uniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients."
  },
  "896": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the glass, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; She then resumed her normal appearance."
  },
  "897": {
    "p": "Dinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at Tommy&rsquo;s non-return. Julius, too, was absent&mdash;but that to the girl&rsquo;s mind was more easily explained. His &ldquo;hustling&rdquo; activities were not confined to London, and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully accepted by the Young Adventurers as part of the day&rsquo;s work. It was quite on the cards that Julius P. Hersheimmer had left for Constantinople at a moment&rsquo;s notice if he fancied that a clue to his cousin&rsquo;s disappearance was to be found there. The energetic young man had succeeded in making the lives of several Scotland Yard men unbearable to them, and the telephone girls at the Admiralty had learned to know and dread the familiar &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; He had spent three hours in Paris hustling the Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with the idea, possibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true clue to the mystery was to be found in Ireland."
  },
  "898": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I dare say he&rsquo;s dashed off there now,&rdquo; thought Tuppence. &ldquo;All very well, but this is very dull for <em>me!</em> Here I am bursting with news, and absolutely no one to tell it to! Tommy might have wired, or something. I wonder where he is. Anyway, he can&rsquo;t have &lsquo;lost the trail&rsquo; as they say. That reminds me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And Miss Cowley broke off in her meditations, and summoned a small boy."
  },
  "899": {
    "p": "Ten minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed, smoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of <em>Garnaby Williams, the Boy Detective</em>, which, with other threepenny works of lurid fiction, she had sent out to purchase. She felt, and rightly, that before the strain of attempting further intercourse with Albert, it would be as well to fortify herself with a good supply of local colour."

  "902": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You have made a splendid start, and I congratulate you. I feel, though, that I should like to point out to you once more the risks you are running, especially if you pursue the course you indicate. Those people are absolutely desperate and incapable of either mercy or pity. I feel that you probably underestimate the danger, and therefore warn you again that I can promise you no protection. You have given us valuable information, and if you choose to withdraw now no one could blame you. At any rate, think the matter over well before you decide."
  },
  "903": {
    "p": "&ldquo;If, in spite of my warnings, you make up your mind to go through with it, you will find everything arranged. You have lived for two years with Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly, and Mrs. Vandemeyer can apply to her for a reference."
  },
  "904": {
    "p": "&ldquo;May I be permitted a word or two of advice? Stick as near to the truth as possible&mdash;it minimizes the danger of &lsquo;slips.&rsquo; I suggest that you should represent yourself to be what you are, a former V.A.D., who has chosen domestic service as a profession. There are many such at the present time. That explains away any incongruities of voice or manner which otherwise might awaken suspicion."

  },
  "909": {
    "p": "With some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had sketched out for herself. Although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain a role indefinitely, she had too much common sense not to recognize the force of Mr. Carter&rsquo;s arguments."
  },

    "p": "At ten-thirty Tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered tin trunk containing her new possessions. It was artistically corded. It was with a slight blush that she rang the bell and ordered it to be placed in a taxi. She drove to Paddington, and left the box in the cloak room. She then repaired with a handbag to the fastnesses of the ladies&rsquo; waiting-room. Ten minutes later a metamorphosed Tuppence walked demurely out of the station and entered a bus."
  },
  "912": {
    "p": "It was a few minutes past eleven when Tuppence again entered the hall of South Audley Mansions. Albert was on the look-out, attending to his duties in a somewhat desultory fashion. He did not immediately recognize Tuppence. When he did, his admiration was unbounded."

  },
  "915": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Your voice too,&rdquo; cried the delighted boy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as English as anything! No, I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal. Annie wasn&rsquo;t best pleased. She&rsquo;s stopped on till to-day&mdash;to oblige, <em>she</em> said, but really it&rsquo;s so as to put you against the place.&rdquo;"

  },
  "919": {
    "p": "Tuppence quelled him with a stern glance, and stepped inside."
  },
  "920": {
    "p": "As she rang the bell of No. 20 she was conscious of Albert&rsquo;s eyes slowly descending beneath the level of the floor."

  "921": {
    "p": "A smart young woman opened the door."
  },

    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come about the place,&rdquo; said Tuppence."
  },
  "923": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rotten place,&rdquo; said the young woman without hesitation. &ldquo;Regular old cat&mdash;always interfering. Accused me of tampering with her letters. Me! The flap was half undone anyway. There&rsquo;s never anything in the waste-paper basket&mdash;she burns everything. She&rsquo;s a wrong &lsquo;un, that&rsquo;s what she is. Swell clothes, but no class. Cook knows something about her&mdash;but she won&rsquo;t tell&mdash;scared to death of her. And suspicious! She&rsquo;s on to you in a minute if you as much as speak to a fellow. I can tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"

    "p": "Tuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage. A woman was standing by the fireplace. She was no longer in her first youth, and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and coarsened. In her youth she must have been dazzling. Her pale gold hair, owing a slight assistance to art, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes, of a piercing electric blue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into the very soul of the person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was enhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse. And yet, despite her swaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you felt instinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a kind of metallic strength that found expression in the tones of her voice and in that gimlet-like quality of her eyes."
  },
  "933": {
    "p": "For the first time Tuppence felt afraid. She had not feared Whittington, but this woman was different. As if fascinated, she watched the long cruel line of the red curving mouth, and again she felt that sensation of panic pass over her. Her usual self-confidence deserted her. Vaguely she felt that deceiving this woman would be very different to deceiving Whittington. Mr. Carter&rsquo;s warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed, she might expect no mercy."
  },
  "934": {
    "p": "Fighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail and run without further delay, Tuppence returned the lady&rsquo;s gaze firmly and respectfully."

The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some hold over her. For the rest, she cooked like a <em>chef</em>, as Tuppence had an opportunity of judging that evening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a guest to dinner, and Tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished table for two. She was a little exercised in her own mind as to this visitor. It was highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington. Although she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her, yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total stranger. However, there was nothing for it but to hope for the best."

She had arranged before leaving the <em>Ritz</em> to have all letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small stationer&rsquo;s shop near at hand where Albert was to call in frequently. True, it was only yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and she told herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd. Still, it was strange that he had sent no word of any kind."

  "979": {
    "p": "Nevertheless, she felt she would give a good deal to overhear what was going on. Possibly, if anything unforeseen had happened, she might get news of Tommy. For some moments she reflected desperately, then her face brightened. She went quickly along the passage to Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s bedroom, which had long French windows leading on to a balcony that ran the length of the flat. Slipping quickly through the window, Tuppence crept noiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window. As she had thought it stood a little ajar, and the voices within were plainly audible."
  },

    "p": "DRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her &ldquo;afternoon out.&rdquo; Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence went herself to the stationer&rsquo;s to make quite sure that nothing had come for her. Satisfied on this point, she made her way to the <em>Ritz</em>. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius Hersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately."
  },
  "1047": {
    "p": "Tuppence&rsquo;s spirits revived still more. It would be something to see Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Julius&rsquo;s sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst open."

  },
  "1068": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Julius, &ldquo;I got into one of your dear old-fashioned first-class British compartments. The train was just off. First thing I knew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely that I wasn&rsquo;t in a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a dollar, and that settled that. I did a bit of prospecting along the corridor to the next coach. Whittington was there right enough. When I saw the skunk, with his big sleek fat face, and thought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt real mad that I hadn&rsquo;t got a gun with me. I&rsquo;d have tickled him up some."
  },
  "1069": {
    "p": "&ldquo;We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and gave the name of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up within three minutes of each other. He hired a room, and I hired one too. So far it was all plain sailing. He hadn&rsquo;t the remotest notion that anyone was on to him. Well, he just sat around in the hotel lounge, reading the papers and so on, till it was time for dinner. He didn&rsquo;t hurry any over that either."
  },
  "1070": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I began to think that there was nothing doing, that he&rsquo;d just come on the trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadn&rsquo;t changed for dinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up hotel, so it seemed likely enough that he&rsquo;d be going out on his real business afterwards."
  },
  "1071": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure enough, about nine o&rsquo;clock, so he did. Took a car across the town&mdash;mighty pretty place by the way, I guess I&rsquo;ll take Jane there for a spell when I find her&mdash;and then paid it off and struck out along those pine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was there too, you understand. We walked, maybe, for half an hour. There&rsquo;s a lot of villas all the way along, but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out, and in the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch. Big house it was, with a lot of piny grounds around it."
  },
  "1072": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the house was dark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I couldn&rsquo;t see him. I had to walk carefully in case he might get on to it that he was being followed. I turned a curve and I was just in time to see him ring the bell and get admitted to the house. I just stopped where I was. It was beginning to rain, and I was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it was almighty cold."
  },
  "1073": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Whittington didn&rsquo;t come out again, and by and by I got kind of restive, and began to mouch around. All the ground floor windows were shuttered tight, but upstairs, on the first floor (it was a two-storied house) I noticed a window with a light burning and the curtains not drawn."
  },
  "1074": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Now, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It was about thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of got it into my head that, if I climbed up that tree, I&rsquo;d very likely be able to see into that room. Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington should be in that room rather than in any other&mdash;less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs. But I guess I&rsquo;d got the hump from standing so long in the rain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I started up."
  },
  "1075": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the boughs mighty slippery, and it was all I could do to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I managed it, until at last there I was level with the window."
  },
  "1076": {
    "p": "&ldquo;But then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could only see sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of wallpaper was all I could command. Well, that wasn&rsquo;t any manner of good to me, but just as I was going to give it up, and climb down ignominiously, some one inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of wall&mdash;and, by gum, it was Whittington!"
  },
  "1077": {
    "p": "&ldquo;After that, my blood was up. I&rsquo;d just <em>got</em> to get a look into that room. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that there was a long branch running out from the tree in the right direction. If I could only swarm about half-way along it, the proposition would be solved. But it was mighty uncertain whether it would bear my weight. I decided I&rsquo;d just got to risk that, and I started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I crawled along. The bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it didn&rsquo;t do to think of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where I wanted to be."
  },
  "1078": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way. There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room, and sitting at that table, facing towards me, was Whittington right enough. He was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse. She was sitting with her back to me, so I couldn&rsquo;t see her face. Although the blinds were up, the window itself was shut, so I couldn&rsquo;t catch a word of what they said. Whittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse just listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she&rsquo;d shake her head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very emphatic&mdash;once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The rain had stopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does."
  },
  "1079": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Presently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying. He got up, and so did she. He looked towards the window and asked something&mdash;I guess it was whether it was raining. Anyway, she came right across and looked out. Just then the moon came out from behind the clouds. I was scared the woman would catch sight of me, for I was full in the moonlight. I tried to move back a bit. The jerk I gave was too much for that rotten old branch. With an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius P. Hersheimmer with it!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1080": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh, Julius,&rdquo; breathed Tuppence, &ldquo;how exciting! Go on.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1081": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of earth&mdash;but it put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The next thing I knew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not Whittington&rsquo;s one) on one side of me, and a little black-bearded man with gold glasses, and medical man written all over him, on the other. He rubbed his hands together, and raised his eyebrows as I stared at him. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;So our young friend is coming round again. Capital. Capital.&rsquo;"
  },
  "1082": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I did the usual stunt. Said: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rsquo; And &lsquo;Where am I?&rsquo; But I knew the answer to the last well enough. There&rsquo;s no moss growing on my brain. &lsquo;I think that&rsquo;ll do for the present, sister,&rsquo; said the little man, and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk well-trained way. But I caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed through the door."
  },
  "1083": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That look of hers gave me an idea. &lsquo;Now then, doc,&rsquo; I said, and tried to sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge as I did so. &lsquo;A slight sprain,&rsquo; explained the doctor. &lsquo;Nothing serious. You&rsquo;ll be about again in a couple of days.&rsquo;&rdquo;"

  },
  "1086": {
    "p": "&ldquo;&lsquo;How did it happen?&rsquo; I asked again. He replied dryly. &lsquo;You fell, with a considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of my newly planted flower-beds.&rsquo;"
  },
  "1087": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt sure that he, at least, was plumb straight. &lsquo;Sure, doc,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about the tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on me. But perhaps you&rsquo;d like to know what I was doing in your garden?&rsquo; &lsquo;I think the facts do call for an explanation,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Well, to begin with, I wasn&rsquo;t after the spoons.&rsquo;"
  },
  "1088": {
    "p": "&ldquo;He smiled. &lsquo;My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By the way, you are an American, are you not?&rsquo; I told him my name. &lsquo;And you?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am Dr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is my private nursing home.&rsquo;"
  },
  "1089": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to put him wise. I was just thankful for the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was straight, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to give him the whole story. For one thing he probably wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it."
  },
  "1090": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I made up my mind in a flash. &lsquo;Why, doctor,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I guess I feel an almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that it wasn&rsquo;t the Bill Sikes business I was up to.&rsquo; Then I went on and mumbled out something about a girl. I trotted out the stern guardian business, and a nervous breakdown, and finally explained that I had fancied I recognized her among the patients at the home, hence my nocturnal adventures. I guess it was just the kind of story he was expecting. &lsquo;Quite a romance,&rsquo; he said genially, when I&rsquo;d finished. &lsquo;Now, doc,&rsquo; I went on, &lsquo;will you be frank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any time, a young girl called Jane Finn?&rsquo; He repeated the name thoughtfully. &lsquo;Jane Finn?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;No.&rsquo;"
  },
  "1091": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. &lsquo;You are sure?&rsquo; &lsquo;Quite sure, Mr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I should not have been likely to forget it.&rsquo;"
  },
  "1092": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. I&rsquo;d kind of hoped my search was at an end. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s that,&rsquo; I said at last. &lsquo;Now, there&rsquo;s another matter. When I was hugging that darned branch I thought I recognized an old friend of mine talking to one of your nurses.&rsquo; I purposely didn&rsquo;t mention any name because, of course, Whittington might be calling himself something quite different down here, but the doctor answered at once. &lsquo;Mr. Whittington, perhaps?&rsquo; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the fellow,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s he doing down here? Don&rsquo;t tell me <em>his</em> nerves are out of order?&rsquo;"

I guess I&rsquo;d like to look him up when I get back.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know his address. I can write to Nurse Edith for it if you like.&rsquo; I thanked him. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say who it is wants it. I&rsquo;d like to give him a little surprise.&rsquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the girl was really Whittington&rsquo;s niece, she might be too cute to fall into the trap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did was to write out a wire to Beresford saying where I was, and that I was laid up with a sprained foot, and telling him to come down if he wasn&rsquo;t busy. I had to be guarded in what I said. However, I didn&rsquo;t hear from him, and my foot soon got all right. It was only ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I said good-bye to the little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if he heard from Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss Tuppence, you&rsquo;re looking mighty pale!&rdquo;"

You&rsquo;re just as plucky as they make &lsquo;em, but I wish you&rsquo;d keep right out of this. These crooks we&rsquo;re up against would as soon croak a girl as a man any day.&rdquo;"

  },
  "1149": {
    "p": "FRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a brief answer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out that the Young Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk, and had been fully warned of the dangers. If anything had happened to Tommy he regretted it deeply, but he could do nothing."
  },
  "1150": {
    "p": "This was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour went out of the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt doubtful of success. While they had been together she had never questioned it for a minute. Although she was accustomed to take the lead, and to pride herself on her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon Tommy more than she realized at the time. There was something so eminently sober and clear-headed about him, his common sense and soundness of vision were so unvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a rudderless ship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much cleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of support. She had accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is certain that he always saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was optimistically given to overlooking, but nevertheless she had really relied a good deal on his judgment. He might be slow, but he was very sure."
  },
  "1151": {
    "p": "It seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the sinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly. It had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn of its glamour, it seemed to be turning to grim reality. Tommy&mdash;that was all that mattered. Many times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely. &ldquo;Little fool,&rdquo; she would apostrophize herself, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t snivel. Of course you&rsquo;re fond of him. You&rsquo;ve known him all your life. But there&rsquo;s no need to be sentimental about it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1152": {
    "p": "In the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come to the flat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence gave herself over to new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth of Julius&rsquo;s objections, she had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Indeed, she had gone so far as to look up his address in the <em>Red Book</em>. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so, why? Surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had looked at her so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning Mrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy&rsquo;s whereabouts."
  },
  "1153": {
    "p": "Anyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders, it was worth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her afternoon out. She would meet Julius, persuade him to her point of view, and they would beard the lion in his den."
  },
  "1154": {
    "p": "When the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading, but Tuppence held firm. &ldquo;It can do no harm,&rdquo; was what she always came back to. In the end Julius gave in, and they proceeded in the car to Carlton House Terrace."
  },
  "1155": {
    "p": "The door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a little nervous. After all, perhaps it <em>was</em> colossal cheek on her part. She had decided not to ask if Sir James was &ldquo;at home,&rdquo; but to adopt a more personal attitude."

    "p": "He ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a library. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and Tuppence noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology. There were several deep-padded leather arm-chairs, and an old-fashioned open hearth. In the window was a big roll-top desk strewn with papers at which the master of the house was sitting."

  "1162": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Tuppence. &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;m afraid I only said that to be quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Hersheimmer, Sir James Peel Edgerton.&rdquo;"

Because, of course, it&rsquo;s nothing whatever to do with you, and then you&rsquo;re a very important person, and of course Tommy and I are very unimportant.&rdquo; She paused for breath."

    "p": "&ldquo;Tommy?&rdquo; queried Sir James, looking across at the American."
  },
  "1167": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s Julius,&rdquo; explained Tuppence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather nervous, and that makes me tell it badly.

  },
  "1175": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sir James, still smiling, &ldquo;without prejudice, then, if I had a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not like to see her in Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s service. I felt it incumbent on me just to give you a hint. It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl. That is all I can tell you.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1176": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Tuppence thoughtfully. &ldquo;Thank you very much. But I&rsquo;m not <em>really</em> inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that she was a bad lot when I went there&mdash;as a matter of fact that&rsquo;s <em>why</em> I went&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off, seeing some bewilderment on the lawyer&rsquo;s face, and went on: &ldquo;I think perhaps I&rsquo;d better tell you the whole story, Sir James. I&rsquo;ve a sort of feeling that you&rsquo;d know in a minute if I didn&rsquo;t tell the truth, and so you might as well know all about it from the beginning. What do you think, Julius?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1177": {
    "p": "&ldquo;As you&rsquo;re bent on it, I&rsquo;d go right ahead with the facts,&rdquo; replied the American, who had so far sat in silence."
  },
  "1178": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, tell me all about it,&rdquo; said Sir James. &ldquo;I want to know who Tommy is.&rdquo;"
  },

    "p": "Thus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale, and the lawyer listened with close attention."
  },
  "1180": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Very interesting,&rdquo; he said, when she finished. &ldquo;A great deal of what you tell me, child, is already known to me. I&rsquo;ve had certain theories of my own about this Jane Finn. You&rsquo;ve done extraordinarily well so far, but it&rsquo;s rather too bad of&mdash;what do you know him as?&mdash;Mr. Carter to pitchfork you two young things into an affair of this kind. By the way, where did Mr. Hersheimmer come in originally? You didn&rsquo;t make that clear?&rdquo;"
  },

  },
  "1185": {
    "p": "&ldquo;H&rsquo;m.&rdquo; The lawyer rose, and paced slowly up and down. &ldquo;When you arrived, young lady, I was just packing up my traps. Going to Scotland by the night train for a few days&rsquo; fishing. But there are different kinds of fishing. I&rsquo;ve a good mind to stay, and see if we can&rsquo;t get on the track of that young chap.&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;Well, Miss Tuppence, then, as I&rsquo;m certainly going to be a friend. Don&rsquo;t be offended because I think you&rsquo;re young. Youth is a failing only too easily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy of yours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "1190": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Tuppence clasped her hands."
  },
  "1191": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Frankly, things look bad for him. He&rsquo;s been butting in somewhere where he wasn&rsquo;t wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don&rsquo;t give up hope.&rdquo;"

  "1192": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And you really will help us? There, Julius! He didn&rsquo;t want me to come,&rdquo; she added by way of explanation."

    "p": "&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen glance. &ldquo;And why was that?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1194": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little business like this.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1195": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He paused a moment. &ldquo;This petty little business, as you call it, bears directly on a very big business, bigger perhaps than either you or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is alive, he may have very valuable information to give us. Therefore, we must find him.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1196": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, but how?&rdquo; cried Tuppence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to think of everything.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1197": {
    "p": "Sir James smiled."
  },
  "1198": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And yet there&rsquo;s one person quite near at hand who in all probability knows where he is, or at all events where he is likely to be.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1199": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked Tuppence, puzzled."
  },
  "1200": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Mrs. Vandemeyer.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1201": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, but she&rsquo;d never tell us.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1202": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Ah, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I shall be able to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to know.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1203": {
    "p": "&ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide."
  },
  "1204": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh, just by asking her questions,&rdquo; replied Sir James easily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we do it, you know.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1205": {
    "p": "He tapped with his finger on the table, and Tuppence felt again the intense power that radiated from the man."
  },
  "1206": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And if she won&rsquo;t tell?&rdquo; asked Julius suddenly."
  },
  "1207": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I think she will. I have one or two powerful levers. Still, in that unlikely event, there is always the possibility of bribery.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1208": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure. And that&rsquo;s where I come in!&rdquo; cried Julius, bringing his fist down on the table with a bang. &ldquo;You can count on me, if necessary, for one million dollars. Yes, sir, one million dollars!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1209": {
    "p": "Sir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny."

  "1214": {
    "p": "Sir James flushed slightly."

  "1215": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a private detective.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1216": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I&rsquo;ve been feeling bad about this money question. I wanted to offer a big reward for news of Jane some days ago, but your crusted institution of Scotland Yard advised me against it. Said it was undesirable.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1217": {
    "p": "&ldquo;They were probably right,&rdquo; said Sir James dryly."
  },
  "1218": {
    "p": "&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all O.K. about Julius,&rdquo; put in Tuppence. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not pulling your leg. He&rsquo;s got simply pots of money.&rdquo;"

  "1219": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The old man piled it up in style,&rdquo; explained Julius. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s get down to it. What&rsquo;s your idea?&rdquo;"

    "p": "Sir James considered for a moment or two."
  },
  "1221": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.&rdquo; He turned to Tuppence. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night, do you know?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1222": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she would have taken the latchkey.&rdquo;"

  "1224": {
    "p": "&ldquo;About nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1225": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion if you did not stay out till the usual time. Be back by nine-thirty. I will arrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait below in a taxi perhaps.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1226": {
    "p": "&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a new Rolls-Royce car,&rdquo; said Tuppence with vicarious pride."
  },
  "1227": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Even better. If I succeed in obtaining the address from her, we can go there at once, taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if necessary. You understand?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1228": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. &ldquo;Oh, I feel so much better!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1229": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1230": {
    "p": "Julius turned to the lawyer."
  },
  "1231": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Say, then. I&rsquo;ll call for you in the car round about nine-thirty. Is that right?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1232": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Perhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to have two cars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to you is to go and have a good dinner, a <em>really</em> good one, mind. And don&rsquo;t think ahead more than you can help.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1233": {
    "p": "He shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were outside."
  },
  "1234": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a duck?&rdquo; inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped down the steps. &ldquo;Oh, Julius, isn&rsquo;t he just a duck?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1235": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was wrong about its being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go right away back to the <em>Ritz?</em>&rdquo;"
  },
  "1236": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the park, will you? Unless you&rsquo;d like to come too?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1237": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I want to get some petrol,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;And send off a cable or two.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1238": {
    "p": "&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll meet you at the <em>Ritz</em> at seven. We&rsquo;ll have to dine upstairs. I can&rsquo;t show myself in these glad rags.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1239": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;ll get Felix help me choose the menu. He&rsquo;s some head waiter, that. So long.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1240": {
    "p": "Tuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine, first glancing at her watch. It was nearly six o&rsquo;clock. She remembered that she had had no tea, but felt too excited to be conscious of hunger. She walked as far as Kensington Gardens and then slowly retraced her steps, feeling infinitely better for the fresh air and exercise. It was not so easy to follow Sir James&rsquo;s advice, and put the possible events of the evening out of her head. As she drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the temptation to return to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible."
  },
  "1241": {
    "p": "At any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and <em>look</em> at the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to waiting patiently for ten o&rsquo;clock."
  },
  "1242": {
    "p": "South Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What Tuppence had expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red brick stolidity slightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness that possessed her. She was just turning away when she heard a piercing whistle, and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join her."
  },
  "1243": {
    "p": "Tuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have attention called to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert was purple with suppressed excitement."
  },
  "1244": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I say, miss, she&rsquo;s a-going!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1245": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going?&rdquo; demanded Tuppence sharply."
  },
  "1246": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She&rsquo;s a-packing up, and she&rsquo;s just sent down word for me to get her a taxi.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1247": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tuppence clutched his arm."
  },
  "1248": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn&rsquo;t know about it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1249": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; cried Tuppence, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a brick. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you we&rsquo;d have lost her.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1250": {
    "p": "Albert flushed with pleasure at this tribute."
  },
  "1251": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to lose,&rdquo; said Tuppence, crossing the road. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to stop her. At all costs I must keep her here until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off. &ldquo;Albert, there&rsquo;s a telephone here, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1252": {
    "p": "The boy shook his head."
  },
  "1253": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The flats mostly have their own, miss. But there&rsquo;s a box just round the corner.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1254": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Go to it then, at once, and ring up the <em>Ritz Hotel</em>. Ask for Mr. Hersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and come on at once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you can&rsquo;t get him, ring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, you&rsquo;ll find his number in the book, and tell him what&rsquo;s happening. You won&rsquo;t forget the names, will you?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1255": {
    "p": "Albert repeated them glibly. &ldquo;You trust to me, miss, it&rsquo;ll be all right. But what about you? Aren&rsquo;t you afraid to trust yourself with her?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1256": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s all right. <em>But go and telephone</em>. Be quick.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1257": {
    "p": "Drawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up to the door of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer until the two men arrived, she did not know, but somehow or other it had to be done, and she must accomplish the task single-handed. What had occasioned this precipitate departure? Did Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her?"
  },
  "1258": {
    "p": "Speculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She might learn something from the cook."
  },
  "1259": {
    "p": "Nothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence pressed the bell again, keeping her finger on the button for some little while. At last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment later Mrs. Vandemeyer herself opened the door. She lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the girl."
  },
  "1260": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1261": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I had a touch of toothache, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Tuppence glibly. &ldquo;So thought it better to come home and have a quiet evening.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1262": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence pass into the hall."
  },
  "1263": {
    "p": "&ldquo;How unfortunate for you,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;You had better go to bed.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1264": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, ma&rsquo;am. Cook will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "1265": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Cook is out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable tone. &ldquo;I sent her out. So you see you had better go to bed.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1266": {
    "p": "Suddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s voice that she did not like at all. Also, the other woman was slowly edging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at bay."
  },
  "1267": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "1268": {
    "p": "Then, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s voice rose cold and menacing:"
  },
  "1269": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You damned little fool! Do you think I don&rsquo;t know? No, don&rsquo;t answer. If you struggle or cry out, I&rsquo;ll shoot you like a dog.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1270": {
    "p": "The rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girl&rsquo;s temple."
  },
  "1271": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Now then, march,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Vandemeyer. &ldquo;This way&mdash;into my room. In a minute, when I&rsquo;ve done with you, you&rsquo;ll go to bed as I told you to. And you&rsquo;ll sleep&mdash;oh yes, my little spy, you&rsquo;ll sleep all right!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1272": {
    "p": "There was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which Tuppence did not at all like. For the moment there was nothing to be done, and she walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s bedroom. The pistol never left her forehead. The room was in a state of wild disorder, clothes were flung about right and left, a suit-case and a hat box, half-packed, stood in the middle of the floor."
  },
  "1273": {
    "p": "Tuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook a little, but she spoke out bravely."
  },
  "1274": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is nonsense. You can&rsquo;t shoot me. Why, every one in the building would hear the report.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1275": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;d risk that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. &ldquo;But, as long as you don&rsquo;t sing out for help, you&rsquo;re all right&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think you will. You&rsquo;re a clever girl. You deceived <em>me</em> all right. I hadn&rsquo;t a suspicion of you! So I&rsquo;ve no doubt that you understand perfectly well that this is where I&rsquo;m on top and you&rsquo;re underneath. Now then&mdash;sit on the bed. Put your hands above your head, and if you value your life don&rsquo;t move them.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1276": {
    "p": "Tuppence obeyed passively. Her good sense told her that there was nothing else to do but accept the situation. If she shrieked for help there was very little chance of anyone hearing her, whereas there was probably quite a good chance of Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s shooting her. In the meantime, every minute of delay gained was valuable."
  },
  "1277": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the washstand within reach of her hand, and, still eyeing Tuppence like a lynx in case the girl should attempt to move, she took a little stoppered bottle from its place on the marble and poured some of its contents into a glass which she filled up with water."
  },
  "1278": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Tuppence sharply."
  },
  "1279": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Something to make you sleep soundly.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1280": {
    "p": "Tuppence paled a little."
  },
  "1281": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Are you going to poison me?&rdquo; she asked in a whisper."
  },
  "1282": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vandemeyer, smiling agreeably."
  },
  "1283": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Then I shan&rsquo;t drink it,&rdquo; said Tuppence firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather be shot. At any rate that would make a row, and some one might hear it. But I won&rsquo;t be killed off quietly like a lamb.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1284": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot."
  },
  "1285": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and cry for murder out after me? If you&rsquo;ve any sense at all, you&rsquo;ll realize that poisoning you wouldn&rsquo;t suit my book at all. It&rsquo;s a sleeping draught, that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ll wake up to-morrow morning none the worse. I simply don&rsquo;t want the bother of tying you up and gagging you. That&rsquo;s the alternative&mdash;and you won&rsquo;t like it, I can tell you! I can be very rough if I choose. So drink this down like a good girl, and you&rsquo;ll be none the worse for it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1286": {
    "p": "In her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her. The arguments she had adduced rang true. It was a simple and effective method of getting her out of the way for the time being. Nevertheless, the girl did not take kindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep without as much as one bid for freedom. She felt that once Mrs. Vandemeyer gave them the slip, the last hope of finding Tommy would be gone."
  },
  "1287": {
    "p": "Tuppence was quick in her mental processes. All these reflections passed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where a chance, a very problematical chance, lay, and she determined to risk all in one supreme effort."
  },
  "1288": {
    "p": "Accordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her knees before Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically."
  },
  "1289": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s poison&mdash;I know it&rsquo;s poison. Oh, don&rsquo;t make me drink it&rdquo;&mdash;her voice rose to a shriek&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t make me drink it!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1290": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at this sudden collapse."
  },
  "1291": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Get up, you little idiot! Don&rsquo;t go on drivelling there. How you ever had the nerve to play your part as you did I can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo; She stamped her foot. &ldquo;Get up, I say.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1292": {
    "p": "But Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs with incoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to the good. Moreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly nearer to her objective."
  },
  "1293": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked the girl to her knees."
  },
  "1294": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Drink it at once!&rdquo; Imperiously she pressed the glass to the girl&rsquo;s lips."
  },
  "1295": {
    "p": "Tuppence gave one last despairing moan."
  },
  "1296": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You swear it won&rsquo;t hurt me?&rdquo; she temporized."
  },
  "1297": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Of course it won&rsquo;t hurt you. Don&rsquo;t be a fool.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1298": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Will you swear it?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1299": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the other impatiently. &ldquo;I swear it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1300": {
    "p": "Tuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass."
  },
  "1301": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Her mouth opened meekly."
  },
  "1302": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief, off her guard for the moment. Then, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward as hard as she could. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s face, and during her momentary gasp, Tuppence&rsquo;s right hand shot out and grasped the revolver where it lay on the edge of the washstand. The next moment she had sprung back a pace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s heart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it."
  },
  "1303": {
    "p": "In the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat unsportsmanlike triumph."
  },
  "1304": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s on top and who&rsquo;s underneath?&rdquo; she crowed."
  },
  "1305": {
    "p": "The other&rsquo;s face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence thought she was going to spring upon her, which would have placed the girl in an unpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the line at actually letting off the revolver. However, with an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled herself, and at last a slow evil smile crept over her face."
  },
  "1306": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Not a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you shall pay for it&mdash;oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long memory!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1307": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you should have been gulled so easily,&rdquo; said Tuppence scornfully. &ldquo;Did you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1308": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You may do&mdash;some day!&rdquo; said the other significantly."
  },
  "1309": {
    "p": "The cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down Tuppence&rsquo;s spine, but she was not going to give in to it."
  },
  "1310": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Supposing we sit down,&rdquo; she said pleasantly. &ldquo;Our present attitude is a little melodramatic. No&mdash;not on the bed. Draw a chair up to the table, that&rsquo;s right. Now I&rsquo;ll sit opposite you with the revolver in front of me&mdash;just in case of accidents. Splendid. Now, let&rsquo;s talk.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1311": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly."
  },
  "1312": {
    "p": "Tuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute. She was remembering several things. Boris&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I believe you would sell&mdash; <em>us!</em>&rdquo; and her answer, &ldquo;The price would have to be enormous,&rdquo; given lightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been blabbing? Rita?&rdquo; Would Rita Vandemeyer prove to be the weak spot in the armour of Mr. Brown?"
  },
  "1313": {
    "p": "Keeping her eyes fixed steadily on the other&rsquo;s face, Tuppence replied quietly:"
  },
  "1314": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "1315": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer started. Clearly, the reply was unexpected."
  },
  "1316": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1317": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. You said just now that you had a long memory. A long memory isn&rsquo;t half as useful as a long purse! I dare say it relieves your feelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of dreadful things to do to me, but is that <em>practical?</em> Revenge is very unsatisfactory. Every one always says so. But money&rdquo;&mdash;Tuppence warmed to her pet creed&mdash;&ldquo;well, there&rsquo;s nothing unsatisfactory about money, is there?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1318": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vandemeyer scornfully, &ldquo;that I am the kind of woman to sell my friends?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1319": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tuppence promptly. &ldquo;If the price was big enough.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1320": {
    "p": "&ldquo;A paltry hundred pounds or so!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1321": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tuppence. &ldquo;I should suggest&mdash;a hundred thousand!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1322": {
    "p": "Her economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole million dollars suggested by Julius."
  },
  "1323": {
    "p": "A flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s face."
  },
  "1324": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she asked, her fingers playing nervously with a brooch on her breast. In that moment Tuppence knew that the fish was hooked, and for the first time she felt a horror of her own money-loving spirit. It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship to the woman fronting her."
  },
  "1325": {
    "p": "&ldquo;A hundred thousand pounds,&rdquo; repeated Tuppence."
  },
  "1326": {
    "p": "The light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s eyes. She leaned back in her chair."
  },
  "1327": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1328": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Tuppence, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;but I know some one who has.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1329": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1330": {
    "p": "&ldquo;A friend of mine.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1331": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Must be a millionaire,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly."
  },
  "1332": {
    "p": "&ldquo;As a matter of fact he is. He&rsquo;s an American. He&rsquo;ll pay you that without a murmur. You can take it from me that it&rsquo;s a perfectly genuine proposition.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1333": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer sat up again."
  },
  "1334": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to believe you,&rdquo; she said slowly."
  },
  "1335": {
    "p": "There was silence between them for some time, then Mrs. Vandemeyer looked up."
  },
  "1336": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What does he want to know, this friend of yours?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1337": {
    "p": "Tuppence went through a momentary struggle, but it was Julius&rsquo;s money, and his interests must come first."
  },
  "1338": {
    "p": "&ldquo;He wants to know where Jane Finn is,&rdquo; she said boldly."
  },
  "1339": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer showed no surprise."
  },
  "1340": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure where she is at the present moment,&rdquo; she replied."
  },
  "1341": {
    "p": "&ldquo;But you could find out?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1342": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Vandemeyer carelessly. &ldquo;There would be no difficulty about that.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1343": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;Tuppence&rsquo;s voice shook a little&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a boy, a friend of mine. I&rsquo;m afraid something&rsquo;s happened to him, through your pal Boris.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1344": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1345": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Tommy Beresford.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1346": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Never heard of him. But I&rsquo;ll ask Boris. He&rsquo;ll tell me anything he knows.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1347": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits. It impelled her to more audacious efforts. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing more.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1348": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1349": {
    "p": "Tuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice."
  },
  "1350": {
    "p": "<em>&ldquo;Who is Mr. Brown?&rdquo;</em>"
  },
  "1351": {
    "p": "Her quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face. With an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to resume her former manner. But the attempt was a mere parody."
  },
  "1352": {
    "p": "She shrugged her shoulders."
  },
  "1353": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have learnt much about us if you don&rsquo;t know that <em>nobody knows who Mr. Brown is</em>....&rdquo;"
  },
  "1354": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said Tuppence quietly."
  },
  "1355": {
    "p": "Again the colour deserted the other&rsquo;s face."
  },
  "1356": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1357": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the girl truthfully. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1358": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time."
  },
  "1359": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said hoarsely, at last, &ldquo;<em>I</em> know. I was beautiful, you see&mdash;very beautiful&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "1360": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You are still,&rdquo; said Tuppence with admiration."
  },
  "1361": {

  "1394": {

    "p": "All three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices. One and all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax. Clearly any scheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the moment. For the time being they were baffled, and could do nothing."
  },
  "1400": {
    "p": "Tuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing to disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented to discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn. Julius was congratulatory."

  },
  "1416": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,&rdquo; said Sir James dryly. &ldquo;We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due care, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our hands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness, but she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should go to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1417": {
    "p": "Tuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she saw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words on her lips."
  },
  "1418": {
    "p": "For a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had been a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly credit the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by magic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a moment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on the alert."

  },
  "1422": {
    "p": "The girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her."
  },
  "1423": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;leave&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring something that sounded like &ldquo;sleepy.&rdquo; Then she tried again."
  },
  "1424": {
    "p": "Tuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath."
  },
  "1425": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Mr.&mdash;Brown&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The voice stopped."
  },
  "1426": {
    "p": "But the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message."
  },
  "1427": {
    "p": "Moved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly:"

  "1428": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1429": {
    "p": "A flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in Tuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: &ldquo;Mr. Brown?&rdquo; Tuppence caught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a man to hide in that.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open and looked inside. No one&mdash;of course! She stooped down and looked under the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place."
  },
  "1430": {
    "p": "Tuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir James were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her."
  },
  "1431": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room.&rdquo;"
  },

  },
  "1433": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; remarked Julius suddenly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Tuppence&rsquo;s bright boy. I guess I&rsquo;d better go down and ease his young mind. That&rsquo;s some lad, Tuppence.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1434": {
    "p": "&ldquo;How did you get in, by the way?&rdquo; asked Tuppence suddenly. &ldquo;I forgot to ask.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1435": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was just a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He&rsquo;d been listening outside the door of the flat, but couldn&rsquo;t hear anything. Anyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell. And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along to find you. Albert&rsquo;s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.&rdquo; With which Julius departed abruptly."
  },
  "1436": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Now then, Miss Tuppence,&rdquo; said Sir James, &ldquo;you know this place better than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?&rdquo;"

  "1437": {
    "p": "Tuppence considered for a moment or two."
  },
  "1438": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I think Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s boudoir would be the most comfortable,&rdquo; she said at last, and led the way there."
  },
  "1439": {
    "p": "Sir James looked round approvingly."
  },
  "1440": {
    "p": "&ldquo;This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and get some sleep.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1441": {
    "p": "Tuppence shook her head resolutely."
  },
  "1442": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown all night!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1443": {
    "p": "&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be so tired, child.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1444": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d rather stay up&mdash;really.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1445": {
    "p": "The lawyer gave in."
  },
  "1446": {
    "p": "Julius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and rewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to persuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:"
  },
  "1447": {
    "p": "&ldquo;At any rate, you&rsquo;ve got to have something to eat right away. Where&rsquo;s the larder?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1448": {
    "p": "Tuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie and three plates."
  },
  "1449": {
    "p": "After a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of half an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail."
  },
  "1450": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And now, Miss Tuppence,&rdquo; said Sir James, &ldquo;we want to hear your adventures.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1451": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Julius."
  },
  "1452": {
    "p": "Tuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius occasionally interjected an admiring &ldquo;Bully.&rdquo; Sir James said nothing until she had finished, when his quiet &ldquo;well done, Miss Tuppence,&rdquo; made her flush with pleasure."
  },
  "1453": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t get clearly,&rdquo; said Julius. &ldquo;What put her up to clearing out?&rdquo;"
  },

    "p": "&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; confessed Tuppence."
  },
  "1455": {
    "p": "Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully."
  },
  "1456": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from some one.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1457": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Mr. Brown, I suppose,&rdquo; said Julius scoffingly."

  "1461": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane&rsquo;s photograph to him like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, I&rsquo;ll freeze on to it like&mdash;like hell!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1462": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That contingency is likely to be a remote one,&rdquo; said the other dryly."
  },
  "1463": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Julius frankly. &ldquo;And, in any case, it&rsquo;s the original I&rsquo;m out after. Where do you think she can be, Sir James?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1464": {
    "p": "The lawyer shook his head."

  "1465": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Impossible to say. But I&rsquo;ve a very good idea where she <em>has</em> been.&rdquo;"

  "1466": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You have? Where?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1467": {

    "p": "&ldquo;At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth nursing home.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1469": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There? Impossible. I asked.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1470": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn had been there. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly be under an assumed name.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1471": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Bully for you,&rdquo; cried Julius. &ldquo;I never thought of that!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1472": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It was fairly obvious,&rdquo; said the other."
  },
  "1473": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Perhaps the doctor&rsquo;s in it too,&rdquo; suggested Tuppence."
  },
  "1474": {
    "p": "Julius shook his head."
  },
  "1475": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I took to him at once. No, I&rsquo;m pretty sure Dr. Hall&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1476": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Hall, did you say?&rdquo; asked Sir James. &ldquo;That is curious&mdash;really very curious.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1477": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded Tuppence."
  },
  "1478": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Because I happened to meet him this morning. I&rsquo;ve known him slightly on and off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street. Staying at the <em>Métropole</em>, he told me.&rdquo; He turned to Julius. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he tell you he was coming up to town?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1479": {
    "p": "Julius shook his head."
  },
  "1480": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; mused Sir James. &ldquo;You did not mention his name this afternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for further information with my card as introduction.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1481": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m a mutt,&rdquo; said Julius with unusual humility. &ldquo;I ought to have thought of the false name stunt.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1482": {
    "p": "&ldquo;How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?&rdquo; cried Tuppence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure anyone else would have been killed right off.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1483": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well, I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter now, anyway,&rdquo; said Julius. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got Mrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that&rsquo;s all we need.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1484": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her voice."
  },
  "1485": {
    "p": "A silence settled down over the party. Little by little the magic of the night began to gain a hold on them. There were sudden creaks of the furniture, imperceptible rustlings in the curtains. Suddenly Tuppence sprang up with a cry."
  },
  "1486": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I know Mr. Brown&rsquo;s somewhere in the flat! I can <em>feel</em> him.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1487": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door&rsquo;s open into the hall. No one could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing him.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1488": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I <em>feel</em> he&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1489": {
    "p": "She looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:"
  },
  "1490": {
    "p": "&ldquo;With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as well for that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to be in the flat without our knowledge.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1491": {
    "p": "The girl was a little comforted by his words."
  },
  "1492": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,&rdquo; she confessed."
  },
  "1493": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sir James. &ldquo;We are in the condition of people holding a séance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous results.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1494": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Do you believe in spiritualism?&rdquo; asked Tuppence, opening her eyes wide."
  },
  "1495": {
    "p": "The lawyer shrugged his shoulders."
  },
  "1496": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony would not pass muster in the witness-box.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1497": {
    "p": "The hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir James drew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners see, the slow rising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow, with the coming of the light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd. Tuppence&rsquo;s spirits revived to the normal."
  },
  "1498": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a gorgeous day. And we shall find Tommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely. I shall ask Mr. Carter if I can&rsquo;t be made a Dame!&rdquo;"
  },
  "1499": {
    "p": "At seven o&rsquo;clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea. She returned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups."
  },
  "1500": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the other cup for?&rdquo; inquired Julius."
  },
  "1501": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1502": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,&rdquo; said Julius thoughtfully."
  },
  "1503": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; admitted Tuppence. &ldquo;But, anyway, here goes. Perhaps you&rsquo;d both come, too, in case she springs on me, or anything. You see, we don&rsquo;t know what mood she&rsquo;ll wake up in.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1504": {
    "p": "Sir James and Julius accompanied her to the door."
  },
  "1505": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the key? Oh, of course, I&rsquo;ve got it myself.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1506": {
    "p": "She put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused."
  },
  "1507": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Supposing, after all, she&rsquo;s escaped?&rdquo; she murmured in a whisper."
  },
  "1508": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Plumb impossible,&rdquo; replied Julius reassuringly."
  },
  "1509": {
    "p": "But Sir James said nothing."
  },
  "1510": {
    "p": "Tuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of relief as she saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed."
  },
  "1511": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she remarked cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you some tea.&rdquo;"
  },
  "1512": {
    "p": "Mrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the table by the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she turned, Mrs. Vandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a sudden fear clutching at her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The hand she lifted was cold as ice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never speak now...."
  },
  "1513": {
    "p": "Her cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs. Vandemeyer was dead&mdash;must have been dead some hours. She had evidently died in her sleep."
  },
  "1514": {
    "p": "&ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t the cruellest luck,&rdquo; cried Julius in despair."
  },
  "1515": {
    "p": "The lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes."
  },
  "1516": {

The doctor accepted quite readily the theory that Mrs. Vandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral. He doubted whether an inquest would be necessary. If so, he would let Sir James know. He understood that Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for abroad, and that the servants had already left? Sir James and his young friends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly stricken down and they had spent the night in the flat, not liking to leave her alone. Did they know of any relatives? They did not, but Sir James referred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s solicitor."

I suggested a specialist, of course.

  },
  "1614": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it! I guess, doc, I&rsquo;d like your medical opinion on the plan I&rsquo;m about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring pond again, and the same thing was to happen. The submarine, the sinking ship, every one to take to the boats&mdash;and so on. Wouldn&rsquo;t that do the trick? Wouldn&rsquo;t it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it functioning again right away?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1615": {

They won&rsquo;t sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be got over. Ever heard of the word &lsquo;graft,&rsquo; sir? Well, graft gets there every time! I reckon that we shan&rsquo;t really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time she&rsquo;s got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck, why&mdash;she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915.

    "p": "Tuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again. Sir James&rsquo;s words sounded in her ears: &ldquo;Never tell all you know&mdash;not even to the person you know best.&rdquo; And like a flash there came into her mind another memory. Julius before the safe in the flat, her own question and the pause before his reply, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Was there really nothing? Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?

But after&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve been day-dreaming ever since I started on this trip&mdash;and these dreams are rotten poor business. I&rsquo;m quit of them.

That&rsquo;s frank, isn&rsquo;t it? I dare say you despise me for it.&rdquo;"

You&rsquo;re so darned plucky. I&rsquo;d just love to give you a real, rattling good time. Say the word, and we&rsquo;ll run round right away to some high-class jeweller, and fix up the ring business.&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. &ldquo;Little fool. Everything you want&mdash;everything you&rsquo;ve ever hoped for, and you go and bleat out &lsquo;no&rsquo; like an idiotic little sheep. It&rsquo;s your one chance. Why don&rsquo;t you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want?&rdquo;"
  },
  "1746": {
    "p": "As if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small snapshot of Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby frame. For a moment she struggled for self-control, and then abandoning all presence, she held it to her lips and burst into a fit of sobbing."

  },
  "1749": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; she observed sternly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look facts in the face. I seem to have fallen in love&mdash;with an idiot of a boy who probably doesn&rsquo;t care two straws about me.&rdquo; Here she paused. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she resumed, as though arguing with an unseen opponent, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>know</em> that he does. He&rsquo;d never have dared to say so. I&rsquo;ve always jumped on sentiment&mdash;and here I am being more sentimental than anybody. What idiots girls are! I&rsquo;ve always thought so. I suppose I shall sleep with his photograph under my pillow, and dream about him all night. It&rsquo;s dreadful to feel you&rsquo;ve been false to your principles.&rdquo;"

Finally she nodded her head as though satisfied, and slipped it into an envelope which she addressed to Julius. She went down the passage to his sitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had expected, the room was empty. She left the note on the table."

When he at last opened his eyes, he was conscious of nothing but an excruciating pain through his temples. He was vaguely aware of unfamiliar surroundings. Where was he? What had happened? He blinked feebly. This was not his bedroom at the <em>Ritz</em>. And what the devil was the matter with his head?"
  },
  "1763": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He was in that sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell back. Through his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully."
  },
  "1764": {
    "p": "&ldquo;He is coming to,&rdquo; remarked a voice very near Tommy&rsquo;s ear. He recognized it at once for that of the bearded and efficient German, and lay artistically inert. He felt that it would be a pity to come round too soon; and until the pain in his head became a little less acute, he felt quite incapable of collecting his wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out what had happened. Obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as he listened and struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew him now for a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift. Undoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was, therefore he need expect no outside assistance, and must depend solely on his own wits."

    "p": "He was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held. On one side of him was the German, on the other the villainous-faced doorkeeper who had let him in.

Tommy Beresford was one of those young Englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual ability, but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a &ldquo;tight place.&rdquo; Their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like a glove.

  "1859": {

The German looked at him searchingly. &ldquo;I wonder whether, after all, you know as much as we think?&rdquo; he said softly."
  },

But equally I&rsquo;ve got something up my sleeve that <em>you</em> don&rsquo;t know about. And that&rsquo;s where I mean to score. Danvers was a damned clever fellow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off as if he had said too much."

  },
  "1891": {
    "p": "Tommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to him to mount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On the floor above Conrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a small room. Conrad lit a hissing gas burner and went out. Tommy heard the sound of the key being turned in the lock."
  },
  "1892": {
    "p": "He set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than the one downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless about the atmosphere of it. Then he realized that there was no window. He walked round it. The walls were filthily dirty, as everywhere else. Four pictures hung crookedly on the wall representing scenes from Faust. Marguerite with her box of jewels, the church scene, Siebel and his flowers, and Faust and Mephistopheles. The latter brought Tommy&rsquo;s mind back to Mr. Brown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its close-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the sinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as he would, no one could ever hear him. The place was a living tomb...."
  },

But on reflection he dismissed the idea."

Tommy stroked his own head tenderly, and gave himself up to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a bright idea flashed across his brain. Why not convert imagination into reality? Conrad was undoubtedly the tenant of the house. The others, with the possible exception of the bearded German, merely used it as a rendezvous. Therefore, why not wait in ambush for Conrad behind the door, and when he entered bring down a chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly on to his head. One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard. And then&mdash;and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way down, well&mdash;&mdash; Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists. Such an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter of this afternoon. Intoxicated by his plan, Tommy gently unhooked the picture of the Devil and Faust, and settled himself in position. His hopes were high. The plan seemed to him simple but excellent."

Night and day were the same in this prison room, but Tommy&rsquo;s wrist-watch, which enjoyed a certain degree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten o&rsquo;clock hope deserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten."

Her hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints of gold in it as though there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths. There was a wild-rose quality about her face. Her eyes, set wide apart, were hazel, a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams."

    "p": "The footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The object Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open. From the way she had studiously avoided looking at him, and her action with the light, he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked. There must be a peep-hole somewhere in the walls. Remembering how guarded she had always been in her manner, he saw that he had probably been under observation all the time. Had he said anything to give himself away? Hardly. He had revealed a wish to escape and a desire to find Jane Finn, but nothing that could have given a clue to his own identity. True, his question to Annette had proved that he was personally unacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended otherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more? Were her denials intended primarily for the listeners? On that point he could come to no conclusion."
  },
  "1994": {
    "p": "But there was a more vital question that drove out all others. Could he, bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to rub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists together. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered &ldquo;Ow&rdquo; of pain from him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt the cord slacken. With his hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes later he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his limbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on the edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the door, so he could expect little more assistance from Annette. The only outlet from the room was the door, consequently he would perforce have to wait until the two men returned to fetch him. But when they did.... Tommy smiled! Moving with infinite caution in the dark room, he found and unhooked the famous picture. He felt an economical pleasure that his first plan would not be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait. He waited."
  },
  "1995": {

  },
  "1996": {
    "p": "The door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad went straight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted that it was he who had entered first. It would have been pleasant to get even with Conrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped across the threshold, Tommy brought the picture down with terrific force on his head. Number 14 went down amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had slipped out and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned it and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from the inside with a volley of curses."
  },
  "1997": {

  },
  "2008": {

  },
  "2029": {
    "p": "Quick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed down the stairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in the hall. He fumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they yielded, the door swung open. He turned. Annette had disappeared."
  },
  "2030": {
    "p": "Tommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What madness possessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood his ground. He would not go without her."

  },
  "2036": {
    "p": "Tommy had run back to the stairs. She wanted him to go and leave her. But why? At all costs he must try and get her away with him. Then his heart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs, uttering a savage cry at the sight of him. After him came the others."
  },
  "2037": {
    "p": "Tommy stopped Conrad&rsquo;s rush with a straight blow with his fist. It caught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a log. The second man tripped over his body and fell. From higher up the staircase there was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommy&rsquo;s ear. He realized that it would be good for his health to get out of this house as soon as possible. As regards Annette he could do nothing. He had got even with Conrad, which was one satisfaction. The blow had been a good one."
  },
  "2038": {
    "p": "He leapt for the door, slamming it behind him. The square was deserted. In front of the house was a baker&rsquo;s van. Evidently he was to have been taken out of London in that, and his body found many miles from the house in Soho. The driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar Tommy&rsquo;s way. Again Tommy&rsquo;s fist shot out, and the driver sprawled on the pavement."
  },
  "2039": {
    "p": "Tommy took to his heels and ran&mdash;none too soon. The front door opened and a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He turned the corner of the square."
  },
  "2040": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t go on shooting. They&rsquo;ll have the police after them if they do. I wonder they dared to there.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2041": {
    "p": "He heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled his own pace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe. There would be a policeman about somewhere&mdash;not that he really wanted to invoke the aid of the police if he could possibly do without it. It meant explanations, and general awkwardness. In another moment he had reason to bless his luck. He stumbled over a prostrate figure, which started up with a yell of alarm and dashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway. In a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom the German was one, industriously tracking down the red herring!"
  },
  "2042": {
    "p": "Tommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments to elapse while he recovered his breath. Then he strolled gently in the opposite direction. He glanced at his watch. It was a little after half-past five. It was rapidly growing light. At the next corner he passed a policeman. The policeman cast a suspicious eye on him. Tommy felt slightly offended. Then, passing his hand over his face, he laughed. He had not shaved or washed for three days! What a guy he must look."
  },
  "2043": {
    "p": "He betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath establishment which he knew to be open all night. He emerged into the busy daylight feeling himself once more, and able to make plans."
  },
  "2044": {
    "p": "First of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing since midday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and ordered eggs and bacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a morning paper propped up in front of him. Suddenly he stiffened. There was a long article on Kramenin, who was described as the &ldquo;man behind Bolshevism&rdquo; in Russia, and who had just arrived in London&mdash;some thought as an unofficial envoy. His career was sketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he, and not the figurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian Revolution."

    "p": "In the centre of the page was his portrait."
  },

  },
  "2047": {
    "p": "He paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There he sent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few minutes later he was in the presence of the man who did not here go by the name of &ldquo;Mr. Carter.&rdquo; There was a frown on his face."
  },
  "2048": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Look here, you&rsquo;ve no business to come asking for me in this way. I thought that was distinctly understood?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2049": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It was, sir. But I judged it important to lose no time.&rdquo;"

  "2052": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Quite right. Every moment&rsquo;s of value. Fear we shall be too late anyway. They wouldn&rsquo;t wait. Would clear out at once. Still, they may have left something behind them that will be a clue. You say you&rsquo;ve recognized Number 1 to be Kramenin? That&rsquo;s important. We want something against him badly to prevent the Cabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about the others? You say two faces were familiar to you? One&rsquo;s a Labour man, you think? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot him.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2053": {
    "p": "A minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some surprise."
  },
  "2054": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Ah, Westway! Shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it. Poses as being moderate. As for the other fellow, I think I can give a good guess.&rdquo; He handed another photograph to Tommy, and smiled at the other&rsquo;s exclamation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right, then. Who is he? Irishman. Prominent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of course. We&rsquo;ve suspected it&mdash;but couldn&rsquo;t get any proof. Yes, you&rsquo;ve done very well, young man. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very little time&mdash;very little time indeed.&rdquo;"

  "2057": {
    "p": "&ldquo;We can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. It&rsquo;s a toss-up&mdash;but we&rsquo;ve got a sporting chance! But if that draft treaty turns up&mdash;we&rsquo;re done. England will be plunged in anarchy. Ah, what&rsquo;s that? The car? Come on, Beresford, we&rsquo;ll go and have a look at this house of yours.&rdquo;"

  "2060": {
    "p": "Going over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the character of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The prison room with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the attic, the meeting room with its long table. But nowhere was there a trace of papers. Everything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away. And there was no sign of Annette."

  },
  "2063": {
    "p": "&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman, didn&rsquo;t feel like standing by to see a personable young man killed. But evidently she&rsquo;s in with them, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have gone back.&rdquo;"

    "p": "Tommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire had given her the chance&mdash;and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was out for money. She had always said so. Why blame her because she had been true to her creed?"
  },
  "2160": {
    "p": "Nevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a passionate and utterly illogical resentment. It was all very well to <em>say</em> things like that&mdash;but a <em>real</em> girl would never marry for money. Tuppence was utterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he would be delighted if he never saw her again! And it was a rotten world!"

  "2165": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure thing. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that? She just rapped out a &lsquo;no&rsquo; without any kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns call it, I&rsquo;ve heard. But she&rsquo;ll come round right enough. Likely enough, I hustled her some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"

Had she not refused Julius without hesitation? True, the note betokened signs of weakening, but he could excuse that. It read almost like a bribe to Julius to spur him on in his efforts to find Tommy, but he supposed she had not really meant it that way. Darling Tuppence, there was not a girl in the world to touch her! When he saw her&mdash;&mdash;His thoughts were brought up with a sudden jerk."
  },
  "2176": {

  },
  "2182": {

    "p": "&ldquo;Of course not. What does it mean?&rdquo;"

  "2187": {

    "p": "<em>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</em>"
  },

  },
  "2191": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Get busy, and go after her! Right now! There&rsquo;s no time to waste. It&rsquo;s almighty luck that she didn&rsquo;t take the wire with her. If she had we&rsquo;d probably never have traced her. But we&rsquo;ve got to hustle. Where&rsquo;s that Bradshaw?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2192": {
    "p": "The energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy would probably have sat down to think things out for a good half-hour before he decided on a plan of action. But with Julius Hersheimmer about, hustling was inevitable."

    "p": "After a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy as being more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it in favour of an A.B.C."

    "p": "&ldquo;Here we are. Ebury, Yorks. From King&rsquo;s Cross. Or St. Pancras. (Boy must have made a mistake. It was King&rsquo;s Cross, not <em>Charing</em> Cross.) 12.50, that&rsquo;s the train she went by. 2.10, that&rsquo;s gone. 3.20 is the next&mdash;and a damned slow train too.&rdquo;"

  "2203": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What I mean is that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s their game to do her any harm,&rdquo; explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his mental processes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a hostage, that&rsquo;s what she is. She&rsquo;s in no immediate danger, because if we tumble on to anything, she&rsquo;d be damned useful to them. As long as they&rsquo;ve got her, they&rsquo;ve got the whip hand of us. See?&rdquo;"

    "p": "Tommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porter&rsquo;s meticulous but perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the station. It was beginning to rain, and they turned up the collars of their coats as they trudged through the slush of the road. Suddenly Tommy halted."
  },
  "2210": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo; He ran back to the station and tackled the porter anew."
  },
  "2211": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Look here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an earlier train, the 12.50 from London? She&rsquo;d probably ask you the way to the Moat House.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2212": {
    "p": "He described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook his head. Several people had arrived by the train in question. He could not call to mind one young lady in particular. But he was quite certain that no one had asked him the way to the Moat House."
  },
  "2213": {
    "p": "Tommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was settling on him like a leaden weight. He felt convinced that their quest was going to be unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours&rsquo; start. Three hours was more than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not ignore the possibility of the telegram having been found."
  },
  "2214": {
    "p": "The way seemed endless. Once they took the wrong turning and went nearly half a mile out of their direction. It was past seven o&rsquo;clock when a small boy told them that &ldquo;t&rsquo; Moat House&rdquo; was just past the next corner."
  },
  "2215": {
    "p": "A rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges! An overgrown drive thick with leaves. There was something about the place that struck a chill to both their hearts. They went up the deserted drive. The leaves deadened their footsteps. The daylight was almost gone. It was like walking in a world of ghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked with a mournful note. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down, startling them with its cold touch on their cheek."
  },
  "2216": {
    "p": "A turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That, too, seemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the steps up to the door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this desolate spot that Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to believe that a human footstep had passed this way for months."
  },
  "2217": {
    "p": "Julius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang discordantly, echoing through the emptiness within. No one came. They rang again and again&mdash;but there was no sign of life. Then they walked completely round the house. Everywhere silence, and shuttered windows. If they could believe the evidence of their eyes the place was empty."
  },
  "2218": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; said Julius."

  "2219": {
    "p": "They retraced their steps slowly to the gate."
  },
  "2220": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There must be a village handy,&rdquo; continued the young American. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better make inquiries there. They&rsquo;ll know something about the place, and whether there&rsquo;s been anyone there lately.&rdquo;"

  "2221": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s not a bad idea.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2222": {

  },
  "2223": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The Moat House? It&rsquo;s empty. Been empty for years. Mrs. Sweeny&rsquo;s got the key if you want to go over it&mdash;next to the post office.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2224": {
    "p": "Tommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was also a sweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of the cottage next to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened it. She readily produced the key of the Moat House."
  },
  "2225": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Though I doubt if it&rsquo;s the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a terrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all. &lsquo;Twould need a lot of money spent on it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2226": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Tommy cheerily. &ldquo;I dare say it&rsquo;ll be a washout, but houses are scarce nowadays.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2227": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That they are,&rdquo; declared the woman heartily. &ldquo;My daughter and son-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I don&rsquo;t know how long. It&rsquo;s all the war. Upset things terribly, it has. But excuse me, sir, it&rsquo;ll be too dark for you to see much of the house. Hadn&rsquo;t you better wait until to-morrow?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2228": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. We&rsquo;ll have a look around this evening, anyway. We&rsquo;d have been here before only we lost our way. What&rsquo;s the best place to stay at for the night round here?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2229": {
    "p": "Mrs. Sweeny looked doubtful."
  },
  "2230": {
    "p": "&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the <em>Yorkshire Arms</em>, but it&rsquo;s not much of a place for gentlemen like you.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2231": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, you&rsquo;ve not had a young lady here asking for this key to-day?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2232": {

    "p": "On the morrow they took up the search once more, and were reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some considerable time. They might have left the village altogether but for a fortunate discovery of Tommy&rsquo;s. As they were retracing their steps to the gate, he gave a sudden cry, and stooping, picked something up from among the leaves, and held it out to Julius. It was a small gold brooch."

    "p": "&ldquo;I guess that settles it. She came as far as here, anyway. We&rsquo;ll make that pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here until we find her. Somebody <em>must</em> have seen her.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2248": {
    "p": "Forthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately and together, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to Tuppence&rsquo;s description had been seen in the vicinity. They were baffled&mdash;but not discouraged. Finally they altered their tactics. Tuppence had certainly not remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed to her having been overcome and carried away in a car. They renewed inquiries. Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House that day? Again they met with no success."
  },
  "2249": {
    "p": "Julius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the neighbourhood daily with unflagging zeal. A grey limousine on which they had set high hopes was traced to Harrogate, and turned out to be the property of a highly respectable maiden lady!"
  },
  "2250": {
    "p": "Each day saw them set out on a new quest. Julius was like a hound on the leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every car that had passed through the village on the fateful day was tracked down. He forced his way into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to a searching cross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his methods, and seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims; but, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering Tuppence&rsquo;s whereabouts. So well had the abduction been planned that the girl seemed literally to have vanished into thin air."
  },
  "2251": {
    "p": "And another preoccupation was weighing on Tommy&rsquo;s mind."
  },
  "2252": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Do you know how long we&rsquo;ve been here?&rdquo; he asked one morning as they sat facing each other at breakfast. &ldquo;A week! We&rsquo;re no nearer to finding Tuppence, <em>and next Sunday is the</em> 29<em>th!</em>&rdquo;"
  },
  "2253": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; said Julius thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost forgotten about the 29th. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2254": {
    "p": "&ldquo;So have I. At least, I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten about the 29th, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence. But to-day&rsquo;s the 23rd, and time&rsquo;s getting short. If we&rsquo;re ever going to get hold of her at all, we must do it before the 29th&mdash;her life won&rsquo;t be worth an hour&rsquo;s purchase afterwards. The hostage game will be played out by then. I&rsquo;m beginning to feel that we&rsquo;ve made a big mistake in the way we&rsquo;ve set about this. We&rsquo;ve wasted time and we&rsquo;re no forrader.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2255": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you there. We&rsquo;ve been a couple of mutts, who&rsquo;ve bitten off a bigger bit than they can chew. I&rsquo;m going to quit fooling right away!&rdquo;"
  },
  "2256": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2257": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;m going to do what we ought to have done a week ago. I&rsquo;m going right back to London to put the case in the hands of your British police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths. Sleuths! It was a piece of damn-fool foolishness! I&rsquo;m through! I&rsquo;ve had enough of it. Scotland Yard for me!&rdquo;"
  },
  "2258": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Tommy slowly. &ldquo;I wish to God we&rsquo;d gone there right away.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2259": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Better late than never. We&rsquo;ve been like a couple of babes playing &lsquo;Here we go round the Mulberry Bush.&rsquo; Now I&rsquo;m going right along to Scotland Yard to ask them to take me by the hand and show me the way I should go. I guess the professional always scores over the amateur in the end. Are you coming along with me?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2260": {
    "p": "Tommy shook his head."
  },
  "2261": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good? One of us is enough. I might as well stay here and nose round a bit longer. Something <em>might</em> turn up. One never knows.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2262": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure thing. Well, so long. I&rsquo;ll be back in a couple of shakes with a few inspectors along. I shall tell them to pick out their brightest and best.&rdquo;"

  "2270": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No. But I found this waiting in London. Just arrived.&rdquo;"

    "p": "He handed the telegraph form to the other. Tommy&rsquo;s eyes opened as he read:"

    "h3": "Chapter XIX. JANE FINN"
  },
  "2277": {
    "p": "&ldquo;MY train got in half an hour ago,&rdquo; explained Julius, as he led the way out of the station. &ldquo;I reckoned you&rsquo;d come by this before I left London, and wired accordingly to Sir James. He&rsquo;s booked rooms for us, and will be round to dine at eight.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2278": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What made you think he&rsquo;d ceased to take any interest in the case?&rdquo; asked Tommy curiously."
  },
  "2279": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What he said,&rdquo; replied Julius dryly. &ldquo;The old bird&rsquo;s as close as an oyster! Like all the darned lot of them, he wasn&rsquo;t going to commit himself till he was sure he could deliver the goods.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2280": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Tommy thoughtfully."
  },
  "2281": {
    "p": "Julius turned on him."
  },
  "2282": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You wonder what?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2283": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Whether that was his real reason.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2284": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure. You bet your life it was.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2285": {
    "p": "Tommy shook his head unconvinced."
  },
  "2286": {
    "p": "Sir James arrived punctually at eight o&rsquo;clock, and Julius introduced Tommy. Sir James shook hands with him warmly."
  },
  "2287": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford. I have heard so much about you from Miss Tuppence&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled involuntarily&mdash;&ldquo;that it really seems as though I already know you quite well.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2288": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned the great lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism of the other&rsquo;s personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The two men, totally unlike so far as physical resemblance went, produced a similar effect. Beneath the weary manner of the one and the professional reserve of the other, lay the same quality of mind, keen-edged like a rapier."
  },
  "2289": {
    "p": "In the meantime he was conscious of Sir James&rsquo;s close scrutiny. When the lawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling that the other had read him through and through like an open book. He could not but wonder what the final judgment was, but there was little chance of learning that. Sir James took in everything, but gave out only what he chose. A proof of that occurred almost at once."
  },
  "2290": {
    "p": "Immediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a flood of eager questions. How had Sir James managed to track the girl? Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case? And so on."
  },
  "2291": {
    "p": "Sir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said:"
  },
  "2292": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Just so, just so. Well, she&rsquo;s found. And that&rsquo;s the great thing, isn&rsquo;t it? Eh! Come now, that&rsquo;s the great thing?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2293": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss Tuppence and I thought you&rsquo;d quit for good and all.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2294": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed operations on his chin. &ldquo;You thought that, did you? Did you really? H&rsquo;m, dear me.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2295": {
    "p": "&ldquo;But I guess I can take it we were wrong,&rdquo; pursued Julius."
  },
  "2296": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that I should go so far as to say that. But it&rsquo;s certainly fortunate for all parties that we&rsquo;ve managed to find the young lady.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2297": {
    "p": "&ldquo;But where is she?&rdquo; demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on another tack. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be sure to bring her along?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2298": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That would hardly be possible,&rdquo; said Sir James gravely."
  },
  "2299": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2300": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident, and has sustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to the infirmary, and on recovering consciousness gave her name as Jane Finn. When&mdash;ah!&mdash;I heard that, I arranged for her to be removed to the house of a doctor&mdash;a friend of mine, and wired at once for you. She relapsed into unconsciousness and has not spoken since.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2301": {
    "p": "&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not seriously hurt?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2302": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Oh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of view, absurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition. Her state is probably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering her memory.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2303": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come back?&rdquo; cried Julius excitedly."
  },
  "2304": {
    "p": "Sir James tapped the table rather impatiently."
  },
  "2305": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Undoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her real name. I thought you had appreciated that point.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2306": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And you just happened to be on the spot,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;Seems quite like a fairy tale.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2307": {
    "p": "But Sir James was far too wary to be drawn."
  },
  "2308": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Coincidences are curious things,&rdquo; he said dryly."
  },
  "2309": {
    "p": "Nevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only suspected. Sir James&rsquo;s presence in Manchester was not accidental. Far from abandoning the case, as Julius supposed, he had by some means of his own successfully run the missing girl to earth. The only thing that puzzled Tommy was the reason for all this secrecy. He concluded that it was a foible of the legal mind."
  },
  "2310": {
    "p": "Julius was speaking."
  },
  "2311": {
    "p": "&ldquo;After dinner,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I shall go right away and see Jane.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2312": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That will be impossible, I fear,&rdquo; said Sir James. &ldquo;It is very unlikely they would allow her to see visitors at this time of night. I should suggest to-morrow morning about ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2313": {
    "p": "Julius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always stirred him to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful personalities."
  },
  "2314": {
    "p": "&ldquo;All the same, I reckon I&rsquo;ll go round there to-night and see if I can&rsquo;t ginger them up to break through their silly rules.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2315": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2316": {
    "p": "The words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked up with a start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with which he raised his glass to his lips shook slightly, but his eyes held Sir James&rsquo;s defiantly. For a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to burst into flame, but in the end Julius lowered his eyes, defeated."
  },
  "2317": {
    "p": "&ldquo;For the moment, I reckon you&rsquo;re the boss.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2318": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;We will say ten o&rsquo;clock then?&rdquo; With consummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. &ldquo;I must confess, Mr. Beresford, that it was something of a surprise to me to see you here this evening. The last I heard of you was that your friends were in grave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had been heard of you for some days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined to think you had got into difficulties.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2319": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I had, sir!&rdquo; Tommy grinned reminiscently. &ldquo;I was never in a tighter place in my life.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2320": {
    "p": "Helped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated account of his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed interest as he brought the tale to a close."
  },
  "2321": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You got yourself out of a tight place very well,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;I congratulate you. You displayed a great deal of ingenuity and carried your part through well.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2322": {
    "p": "Tommy blushed, his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise."
  },
  "2323": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have got away but for the girl, sir.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2324": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Sir James smiled a little. &ldquo;It was lucky for you she happened to&mdash;er&mdash;take a fancy to you.&rdquo; Tommy appeared about to protest, but Sir James went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about her being one of the gang, I suppose?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2325": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, sir. I thought perhaps they were keeping her there by force, but the way she acted didn&rsquo;t fit in with that. You see, she went back to them when she could have got away.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2326": {
    "p": "Sir James nodded thoughtfully."
  },
  "2327": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to Marguerite?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2328": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2329": {
    "p": "&ldquo;She always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends spoke of her as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been in the habit of calling her by her full name. And, at the moment she was crying out to her, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or dying! Curious! There are one or two points that strike me as being obscure&mdash;their sudden change of attitude towards yourself, for instance. By the way, the house was raided, of course?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2330": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, sir, but they&rsquo;d all cleared out.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2331": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Sir James dryly."
  },
  "2332": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And not a clue left behind.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2333": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully."
  },
  "2334": {
    "p": "Something in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man&rsquo;s eyes have seen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke impulsively:"
  },
  "2335": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d been there, sir, to go over the house!&rdquo;"
  },
  "2336": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I wish I had,&rdquo; said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in silence. Then he looked up. &ldquo;And since then? What have you been doing?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2337": {
    "p": "For a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of course the lawyer did not know."
  },
  "2338": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I forgot that you didn&rsquo;t know about Tuppence,&rdquo; he said slowly. The sickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing Jane Finn was found at last, swept over him again."
  },
  "2339": {
    "p": "The lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply."
  },
  "2340": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Has anything happened to Miss Tuppence?&rdquo; His voice was keen-edged."
  },
  "2341": {
    "p": "&ldquo;She&rsquo;s disappeared,&rdquo; said Julius."
  },
  "2342": {
    "p": "&ldquo;When?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2343": {
    "p": "&ldquo;A week ago.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2344": {
    "p": "&ldquo;How?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2345": {
    "p": "Sir James&rsquo;s questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and Julius gave the history of the last week and their futile search."
  },
  "2346": {
    "p": "Sir James went at once to the root of the matter."
  },
  "2347": {
    "p": "&ldquo;A wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for that. They weren&rsquo;t sure of how much you had learnt in that house. Their kidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your escape. If necessary they could seal your lips with a threat of what might happen to her.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2348": {
    "p": "Tommy nodded."
  },
  "2349": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I thought, sir.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2350": {
    "p": "Sir James looked at him keenly. &ldquo;You had worked that out, had you? Not bad&mdash;not at all bad. The curious thing is that they certainly did not know anything about you when they first held you prisoner. You are sure that you did not in any way disclose your identity?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2351": {
    "p": "Tommy shook his head."
  },
  "2352": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Julius with a nod. &ldquo;Therefore I reckon some one put them wise&mdash;and not earlier than Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2353": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes, but who?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2354": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That almighty omniscient Mr. Brown, of course!&rdquo;"
  },
  "2355": {
    "p": "There was a faint note of derision in the American&rsquo;s voice which made Sir James look up sharply."
  },
  "2356": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2357": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No, sir, I do not,&rdquo; returned the young American with emphasis. &ldquo;Not as such, that is to say. I reckon it out that he&rsquo;s a figurehead&mdash;just a bogy name to frighten the children with. The real head of this business is that Russian chap Kramenin. I guess he&rsquo;s quite capable of running revolutions in three countries at once if he chose! The man Whittington is probably the head of the English branch.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2358": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I disagree with you,&rdquo; said Sir James shortly. &ldquo;Mr. Brown exists.&rdquo; He turned to Tommy. &ldquo;Did you happen to notice where that wire was handed in?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2359": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No, sir, I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2360": {
    "p": "&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. Got it with you?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2361": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s upstairs, sir, in my kit.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2362": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. You&rsquo;ve wasted a week&rdquo;&mdash;Tommy hung his head&mdash;&ldquo;a day or so more is immaterial. We&rsquo;ll deal with Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards, we&rsquo;ll set to work to rescue Miss Tuppence from bondage. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s in any immediate danger. That is, so long as they don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;ve got Jane Finn, and that her memory has returned. We must keep that dark at all costs. You understand?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2363": {
    "p": "The other two assented, and, after making arrangements for meeting on the morrow, the great lawyer took his leave."
  },
  "2364": {
    "p": "At ten o&rsquo;clock, the two young men were at the appointed spot. Sir James had joined them on the doorstep. He alone appeared unexcited. He introduced them to the doctor."
  },
  "2365": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Mr. Hersheimmer&mdash;Mr. Beresford&mdash;Dr. Roylance. How&rsquo;s the patient?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2366": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Going on well. Evidently no idea of the flight of time. Asked this morning how many had been saved from the <em>Lusitania</em>. Was it in the papers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be expected. She seems to have something on her mind, though.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2367": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I think we can relieve her anxiety. May we go up?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2368": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2369": {
    "p": "Tommy&rsquo;s heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor upstairs. Jane Finn at last! The long-sought, the mysterious, the elusive Jane Finn! How wildly improbable success had seemed! And here in this house, her memory almost miraculously restored, lay the girl who held the future of England in her hands. A half groan broke from Tommy&rsquo;s lips. If only Tuppence could have been at his side to share in the triumphant conclusion of their joint venture! Then he put the thought of Tuppence resolutely aside. His confidence in Sir James was growing. There was a man who would unerringly ferret out Tuppence&rsquo;s whereabouts. In the meantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart. It seemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead ... stricken down by the hand of Mr. Brown?"
  },
  "2370": {
    "p": "In another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies. The doctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On the white bed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the whole scene seemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected that it gave the effect of being beautifully staged."
  },
  "2371": {
    "p": "The girl looked from one to the other of them with large wondering eyes. Sir James spoke first."
  },
  "2372": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Miss Finn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is your cousin, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.&rdquo;"

  "2376": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Are you really Uncle Hiram&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; she asked wonderingly."

    "p": "&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2379": {
    "p": "&ldquo;We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,&rdquo; continued the girl, in her low soft tones. &ldquo;But I never thought I&rsquo;d meet you one day. Mother figured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get over being mad with her.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2380": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The old man was like that,&rdquo; admitted Julius. &ldquo;But I guess the new generation&rsquo;s sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business. First thing I thought about, soon as the war was over, was to come along and hunt you up.&rdquo;"

I took the oilskin packet from round my neck and shoved it right in as far as I could. Then I tore off a bit of gorse&mdash;My! but it did prick&mdash;and plugged the hole with it so that you&rsquo;d never guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I marked the place carefully in my own mind, so that I&rsquo;d find it again. There was a queer boulder in the path just there&mdash;for all the world like a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the road. The car was waiting, and I drove back. I just caught the train. I was a bit ashamed of myself for fancying things maybe, but, by and by, I saw the man opposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me, and I felt scared again, and was glad the papers were safe. I went out in the corridor to get a little air. I thought I&rsquo;d slip into another carriage. But the woman called me back, said I&rsquo;d dropped something, and when I stooped to look, something seemed to hit me&mdash;here.&rdquo; She placed her hand to the back of her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember anything more until I woke up in the hospital.&rdquo;"

The way I reason is this: as a last chance they&rsquo;ll let Jane Finn escape in the hope that she&rsquo;s been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she thinks she&rsquo;s free she&rsquo;ll go right away to the cache. Of course it&rsquo;s an awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about them&mdash;but they&rsquo;re pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty. <em>But if they know that the papers have been recovered by us</em>, neither of those two girls&rsquo; lives will be worth an hour&rsquo;s purchase.

  },
  "2673": {

  },
  "2675": {

  },
  "2678": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there, sir. You can count on me.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2679": {
    "p": "As Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable ally. The two took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse. To Albert fell the task of collecting information. There was no difficulty about it."
  },
  "2680": {
    "p": "Astley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no longer practiced, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took a few private patients&mdash;here the good fellow tapped his forehead knowingly&mdash;&ldquo;balmy ones! You understand!&rdquo; The doctor was a popular figure in the village, subscribed freely to all the local sports&mdash;&ldquo;a very pleasant, affable gentleman.&rdquo; Been there long? Oh, a matter of ten years or so&mdash;might be longer. Scientific gentleman, he was. Professors and people often came down from town to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors."
  },
  "2681": {
    "p": "In the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it possible that this genial, well-known figure could be in reality a dangerous criminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No hint of sinister doings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake? Tommy felt a cold chill at the thought."
  },
  "2682": {
    "p": "Then he remembered the private patients&mdash;&ldquo;balmy ones.&rdquo; He inquired carefully if there was a young lady amongst them, describing Tuppence. But nothing much seemed to be known about the patients&mdash;they were seldom seen outside the grounds. A guarded description of Annette also failed to provoke recognition."
  },
  "2683": {
    "p": "Astley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by well-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from observation from the road."
  },
  "2684": {
    "p": "On the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the grounds. Owing to Albert&rsquo;s insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on their stomachs, thereby producing a great deal more noise than if they had stood upright. In any case, these precautions were totally unnecessary. The grounds, like those of any other private house after nightfall, seemed untenanted. Tommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog. Albert&rsquo;s fancy ran to a puma, or a tame cobra. But they reached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested."
  },
  "2685": {
    "p": "The blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large company assembled round the table. The port was passing from hand to hand. It seemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the open window scraps of conversation floated out disjointedly on the night air. It was a heated discussion on county cricket!"
  },
  "2686": {
    "p": "Again Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed impossible to believe that these people were other than they seemed. Had he been fooled once more? The fair-bearded, spectacled gentleman who sat at the head of the table looked singularly honest and normal."
  },
  "2687": {
    "p": "Tommy slept badly that night. The following morning the indefatigable Albert, having cemented an alliance with the greengrocer&rsquo;s boy, took the latter&rsquo;s place and ingratiated himself with the cook at Malthouse. He returned with the information that she was undoubtedly &ldquo;one of the crooks,&rdquo; but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination. Questioned, he could adduce nothing in support of his statement except his own opinion that she wasn&rsquo;t the usual kind. You could see that at a glance."
  },
  "2688": {
    "p": "The substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage of the real greengrocer&rsquo;s boy) on the following day, Albert brought back the first piece of hopeful news. There <em>was</em> a French young lady staying in the house. Tommy put his doubts aside. Here was confirmation of his theory. But time pressed. To-day was the 27th. The 29th was the much-talked-of &ldquo;Labour Day,&rdquo; about which all sorts of rumours were running riot. Newspapers were getting agitated. Sensational hints of a Labour <em>coup d&rsquo;état</em> were freely reported. The Government said nothing. It knew and was prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the Labour leaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among them realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow to the England that at heart they loved. They shrank from the starvation and misery a general strike would entail, and were willing to meet the Government half-way. But behind them were subtle, insistent forces at work, urging the memories of old wrongs, deprecating the weakness of half-and-half measures, fomenting misunderstandings."
  },
  "2689": {
    "p": "Tommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position fairly accurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr. Brown, public opinion would swing to the side of the Labour extremists and revolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an even chance. The Government with a loyal army and police force behind them might win&mdash;but at a cost of great suffering. But Tommy nourished another and a preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown unmasked and captured he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the whole organization would crumble ignominiously and instantaneously. The strange permeating influence of the unseen chief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an instant panic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an eleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible."
  },
  "2690": {
    "p": "&ldquo;This is a one-man show,&rdquo; said Tommy to himself. &ldquo;The thing to do is to get hold of the man.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2691": {
    "p": "It was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had requested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft treaty was Tommy&rsquo;s bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his own presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he stuck tenaciously to his idea."
  },
  "2692": {
    "p": "That evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of Astley Priors. Tommy&rsquo;s ambition was somehow or other to gain admission to the house itself. As they approached cautiously, Tommy gave a sudden gasp."
  },
  "2693": {
    "p": "On the second floor window some one standing between the window and the light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind. It was one Tommy would have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that house!"
  },
  "2694": {
    "p": "He clutched Albert by the shoulder."
  },
  "2695": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Stay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2696": {
    "p": "He retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began in a deep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following ditty:"
  },
  "2697": {
    "p": "I am a Soldier A jolly British Soldier; You can see that I&rsquo;m a Soldier by my feet...."
  },
  "2698": {
    "p": "It had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence&rsquo;s hospital days. He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw her own conclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice, but his lungs were excellent. The noise he produced was terrific."
  },
  "2699": {
    "p": "Presently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally unimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler remonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the butler affectionately as &ldquo;dear old whiskers.&rdquo; The footman took him by one arm, the butler by the other. They ran him down the drive, and neatly out of the gate. The butler threatened him with the police if he intruded again. It was beautifully done&mdash;soberly and with perfect decorum. Anyone would have sworn that the butler was a real butler, the footman a real footman&mdash;only, as it happened, the butler was Whittington!"
  },
  "2700": {
    "p": "Tommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert&rsquo;s return. At last that worthy made his appearance."
  },
  "2701": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried Tommy eagerly."
  },
  "2702": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. While they was a-running of you out the window opened, and something was chucked out.&rdquo; He handed a scrap of paper to Tommy. &ldquo;It was wrapped round a letterweight.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2703": {
    "p": "On the paper were scrawled three words: &ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;same time.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2704": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Good egg!&rdquo; cried Tommy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting going.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2705": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone, and chucked it through the window,&rdquo; continued Albert breathlessly."
  },
  "2706": {
    "p": "Tommy groaned."
  },
  "2707": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Your zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2708": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Said we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to come there and croak like a frog.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2709": {
    "p": "&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll know that&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; said Tommy with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Your imagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you wouldn&rsquo;t recognize a frog croaking if you heard it.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2710": {
    "p": "Albert looked rather crest-fallen."
  },
  "2711": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;No harm done. That butler&rsquo;s an old friend of mine&mdash;I bet he knew who I was, though he didn&rsquo;t let on. It&rsquo;s not their game to show suspicion. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve found it fairly plain sailing. They don&rsquo;t want to discourage me altogether. On the other hand, they don&rsquo;t want to make it too easy. I&rsquo;m a pawn in their game, Albert, that&rsquo;s what I am. You see, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly might suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that promising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who&rsquo;s blundered in just at the right moment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!&rdquo;"
  },
  "2712": {
    "p": "Tommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had elaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure that the inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with him up to a certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a surprise."
  },
  "2713": {
    "p": "About twelve o&rsquo;clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was told that some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant proved to be a rude-looking carter well coated with mud."

  "2714": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Well, my good fellow, what is it?&rdquo; asked Tommy."
  },
  "2715": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Might this be for you, sir?&rdquo; The carter held out a very dirty folded note, on the outside of which was written: &ldquo;Take this to the gentleman at the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you ten shillings.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2716": {
    "p": "The handwriting was Tuppence&rsquo;s. Tommy appreciated her quick-wittedness in realizing that he might be staying at the inn under an assumed name. He snatched at it."

Little Willie and I will come behind. Put on a thick coat, that&rsquo;s right. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we&rsquo;re ready. We walk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car&rsquo;s waiting. And don&rsquo;t you forget I&rsquo;ve got you covered every inch of the way. I can shoot just as well through my coat pocket. One word, or a glance even, at one of those liveried menials, and there&rsquo;ll sure be a strange face in the Sulphur and Brimstone Works!&rdquo;"

    "p": "Slowing down, the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they were just coming into Gatehouse. Julius bade the Russian direct them. His plan was to drive straight up to the house. There Kramenin was to ask for the two girls. Julius explained to him that Little Willie would not be tolerant of failure. Kramenin, by this time, was as putty in the other&rsquo;s hands. The terrific pace they had come had still further unmanned him. He had given himself up for dead at every corner."

    "p": "Whittington turned and ran back into the house. The agonizing minutes went by. Then&mdash;two figures hastily huddled in cloaks appeared on the steps and were hustled into the car. The smaller of the two was inclined to resist and Whittington shoved her in unceremoniously. Julius leaned forward, and in doing so the light from the open door lit up his face. Another man on the steps behind Whittington gave a startled exclamation. Concealment was at an end."
  },
  "2844": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Get a move on, George,&rdquo; shouted Julius."

  "2845": {
    "p": "The chauffeur slipped in his clutch, and with a bound the car started."
  },
  "2846": {
    "p": "The man on the steps uttered an oath. His hand went to his pocket. There was a flash and a report. The bullet just missed the taller girl by an inch."
  },
  "2847": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Get down, Jane,&rdquo; cried Julius. &ldquo;Flat on the bottom of the car.&rdquo; He thrust her sharply forward, then standing up, he took careful aim and fired."

    "p": "&ldquo;Of course I am. Where&rsquo;s Tommy? And who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; She indicated the shivering Kramenin."
  },
  "2851": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Tommy&rsquo;s making tracks for the Argentine. I guess he thought you&rsquo;d turned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George! That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;ll take &lsquo;em at least five minutes to get busy after us. They&rsquo;ll use the telephone, I guess, so look out for snares ahead&mdash;and don&rsquo;t take the direct route. Who&rsquo;s this, did you say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur Kramenin. I persuaded him to come on the trip for his health.&rdquo;"

  "2854": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just couldn&rsquo;t refuse!&rdquo;"
  },
  "2855": {
    "p": "This was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently:"
  },
  "2856": {

  },
  "2858": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Let me go, then,&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;I have done what you asked. Why do you still keep me with you?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2859": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Not for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right off now if you want to. I thought you&rsquo;d rather I tooled you back to London.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2860": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You may never reach London,&rdquo; snarled the other. &ldquo;Let me go here and now.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2861": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman&rsquo;s not making the return trip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall expect a rousing welcome, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"
  },
  "2862": {
    "p": "But before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had finally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared into the night."
  },
  "2863": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Just a mite impatient to leave us,&rdquo; commented Julius, as the car gathered way again. &ldquo;And no idea of saying good-bye politely to the ladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2864": {
    "p": "For the first time the girl spoke."
  },
  "2865": {
    "p": "&ldquo;How did you &lsquo;persuade&rsquo; him?&rdquo; she asked."

  "2867": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Little Willie here takes the credit!&rdquo;"
  },

  },
  "2869": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Annette and I didn&rsquo;t know what was going to happen to us,&rdquo; said Tuppence. &ldquo;Old Whittington hurried us off. <em>We</em> thought it was lambs to the slaughter.&rdquo;"

  "2870": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Annette,&rdquo; said Julius. &ldquo;Is that what you call her?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2871": {
    "p": "His mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea."
  },
  "2872": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her name,&rdquo; said Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide."
  },
  "2873": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; retorted Julius. &ldquo;She may think it&rsquo;s her name, because her memory&rsquo;s gone, poor kid. But it&rsquo;s the one real and original Jane Finn we&rsquo;ve got here.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2874": {
    "p": "&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Tuppence."
  },
  "2875": {
    "p": "But she was interrupted. With an angry spurt, a bullet embedded itself in the upholstery of the car just behind her head."
  },
  "2876": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Down with you,&rdquo; cried Julius. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ambush. These guys have got busy pretty quickly. Push her a bit, George.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2877": {
    "p": "The car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but went happily wide. Julius, upright, leant over the back of the car."
  },
  "2878": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Nothing to shoot at,&rdquo; he announced gloomily. &ldquo;But I guess there&rsquo;ll be another little picnic soon. Ah!&rdquo;"
  },
  "2879": {
    "p": "He raised his hand to his cheek."
  },
  "2880": {
    "p": "&ldquo;You are hurt?&rdquo; said Annette quickly."
  },
  "2881": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Only a scratch.&rdquo;"
  },
  "2882": {
    "p": "The girl sprang to her feet."
  },
  "2883": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they&rsquo;re after. I&rsquo;m the one they want. You shall not lose your lives because of me. Let me go.&rdquo; She was fumbling with the fastenings of the door."
  },
  "2884": {
    "p": "Julius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken with no trace of foreign accent."
  },
  "2885": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Sit down, kid,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with your memory. Been fooling them all the time, eh?&rdquo;"
  },
  "2886": {
    "p": "The girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into tears. Julius patted her on the shoulder."

    "p": "&ldquo;There, there&mdash;just you sit tight. We&rsquo;re not going to let you quit.&rdquo;"
  },

  "2890": {

But in her own mind she was far from feeling the confidence displayed in her words.

The success of these unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly on the pavement. Tuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they sought was some way down.

He asked me if I was a patriotic American, and told me he was carrying papers which were just life or death to the Allies. He asked me to take charge of them. I was to watch for an advertisement in the <em>Times</em>. If it didn&rsquo;t appear, I was to take them to the American Ambassador."

He might have been shadowed from New York, but he didn&rsquo;t think so. At first I had no suspicions, but on the boat to Holyhead I began to get uneasy. There was one woman who had been very keen to look after me, and chum up with me generally&mdash;a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I&rsquo;d been only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was something about her I didn&rsquo;t like, and on the Irish boat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they looked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that she&rsquo;d been quite near me on the <em>Lusitania</em> when Mr. Danvers gave me the packet, and before that she&rsquo;d tried to talk to him once or twice. I began to get scared, but I didn&rsquo;t quite see what to do."

One thing I&rsquo;d done already as a precaution&mdash;ripped open the oilskin packet and substituted blank paper, and then sewn it up again. So, if anyone did manage to rob me of it, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter."

    "p": "&ldquo;At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that looked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn&rsquo;t want to go. There was something uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the carriage&mdash;there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just opposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. I had leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they thought I was asleep, but my eyes weren&rsquo;t quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking man get something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he did so he <em>winked</em>...."

  "2985": {

I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stand up against torture very long."

Then I opened my eyes and started babbling in <em>French!</em>"

  },
  "2992": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been talking to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He spoke to me in French. His voice was very ordinary and quiet, but somehow, I don&rsquo;t know why, he scared me worse than the woman. I felt he&rsquo;d seen right through me, but I went on playing my part. I asked again where I was, and then went on that there was something I <em>must</em> remember&mdash;<em>must</em> remember&mdash;only for the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more distressed. He asked me my name. I said I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;that I couldn&rsquo;t remember anything at all."
  },
  "2993": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain was awful. I screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but I managed to shriek out things in French. I don&rsquo;t know how long I could have gone on, but luckily I fainted. The last thing I heard was his voice saying: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not bluff! Anyway, a kid of her age wouldn&rsquo;t know enough.&rsquo; I guess he forgot American girls are older for their age than English ones, and take more interest in scientific subjects."
  },
  "2994": {
    "p": "&ldquo;When I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She&rsquo;d had her orders, I guess. She spoke to me in French&mdash;told me I&rsquo;d had a shock and been very ill. I should be better soon. I pretended to be rather dazed&mdash;murmured something about the &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; having hurt my wrist. She looked relieved when I said that."
  },
  "2995": {
    "p": "&ldquo;By and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious still, and lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however, I got up and walked round the room, examining it. I thought that even if anyone <em>was</em> watching me from somewhere, it would seem natural enough under the circumstances. It was a squalid, dirty place. There were no windows, which seemed queer. I guessed the door would be locked, but I didn&rsquo;t try it. There were some battered old pictures on the walls, representing scenes from <em>Faust</em>.&rdquo;"

  "2998": {
    "p": "&ldquo;If only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked! I looked carefully round the walls. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be a peep-hole of any kind&mdash;nevertheless I felt kind of sure there must be. All of a sudden I sat down on the edge of the table, and put my face in my hands, sobbing out a &lsquo;Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got very sharp ears. I distinctly heard the rustle of a dress, and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was being watched!"
  },
  "2999": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer brought me some supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I guess she&rsquo;d been told to win my confidence.

  },
  "3000": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then I shook my head. I said that I felt I <em>ought</em> to remember something about it, that it was just as though it was all coming back, and then, before I could get hold of it, it went again. Then she told me that I was her niece, and that I was to call her &lsquo;Aunt Rita.&rsquo; I did obediently, and she told me not to worry&mdash;my memory would soon come back."
  },
  "3001": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That was an awful night. I&rsquo;d made my plan whilst I was waiting for her. The papers were safe so far, but I couldn&rsquo;t take the risk of leaving them there any longer. They might throw that magazine away any minute. I lay awake waiting until I judged it must be about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Then I got up as softly as I could, and felt in the dark along the left-hand wall. Very gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its nail&mdash;Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my coat and took out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I had shoved in. Then I went to the washstand, and damped the brown paper at the back of the picture all round. Presently I was able to pull it away. I had already torn out the two stuck-together pages from the magazine, and now I slipped them with their precious enclosure between the picture and its brown paper backing. A little gum from the envelopes helped me to stick the latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been tampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in my coat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my hiding-place. They&rsquo;d never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures. I hoped that they&rsquo;d come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying a dummy all along, and that, in the end, they&rsquo;d let me go."
  },
  "3002": {
    "p": "&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I guess that&rsquo;s what they did think at first, and, in a way, it was dangerous for me. I learnt afterwards that they nearly did away with me then and there&mdash;there was never much chance of their &lsquo;letting me go&rsquo;&mdash;but the first man, who was the boss, preferred to keep me alive on the chance of my having hidden them, and being able to tell where if I recovered my memory. They watched me constantly for weeks. Sometimes they&rsquo;d ask me questions by the hour&mdash;I guess there was nothing they didn&rsquo;t know about the third degree!&mdash;but somehow I managed to hold my own. The strain of it was awful, though...."
  },
  "3003": {
    "p": "&ldquo;They took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the journey again, in case I&rsquo;d hidden it somewhere <em>en route</em>. Mrs. Vandemeyer and another woman never left me for a moment. They spoke of me as a young relative of Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s whose mind was affected by the shock of the <em>Lusitania</em>. There was no one I could appeal to for help without giving myself away to <em>them</em>, and if I risked it and failed&mdash;and Mrs. Vandemeyer looked so rich, and so beautifully dressed, that I felt convinced they&rsquo;d take her word against mine, and think it was part of my mental trouble to think myself &lsquo;persecuted&rsquo;&mdash;I felt that the horrors in store for me would be too awful once they knew I&rsquo;d been only shamming.&rdquo;"

  "3004": {
    "p": "Sir James nodded comprehendingly."
  },
  "3005": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Mrs. Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality. With that and her social position she would have had little difficulty in imposing her point of view in preference to yours. Your sensational accusations against her would not easily have found credence.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3006": {
    "p": "&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a sanatorium at Bournemouth. I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind at first whether it was a sham affair or genuine. A hospital nurse had charge of me. I was a special patient. She seemed so nice and normal that at last I determined to confide in her. A merciful providence just saved me in time from falling into the trap. My door happened to be ajar, and I heard her talking to some one in the passage. <em>She was one of them!</em> They still fancied it might be a bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make sure! After that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody."
  },
  "3007": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost forgot that I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the part of Janet Vandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks. I became really ill&mdash;for months I sank into a sort of stupor. I felt sure I should die soon, and that nothing really mattered. A sane person shut up in a lunatic asylum often ends by becoming insane, they say. I guess I was like that. Playing my part had become second nature to me. I wasn&rsquo;t even unhappy in the end&mdash;just apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the years went on."
  },
  "3008": {
    "p": "&ldquo;And then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came down from London. She and the doctor asked me questions, experimented with various treatments. There was some talk of sending me to a specialist in Paris. In the end, they did not dare risk it. I overheard something that seemed to show that other people&mdash;friends&mdash;were looking for me. I learnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to Paris, and consulted a specialist, representing herself to be me. He put her through some searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be fraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced them on me. I dare say I couldn&rsquo;t have deceived the specialist for a minute&mdash;a man who has made a lifelong study of a thing is unique&mdash;but I managed once again to hold my own with them. The fact that I&rsquo;d not thought of myself as Jane Finn for so long made it easier."
  },
  "3009": {
    "p": "&ldquo;One night I was whisked off to London at a moment&rsquo;s notice. They took me back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the sanatorium I felt different&mdash;as though something in me that had been buried for a long time was waking up again."
  },
  "3010": {
    "p": "&ldquo;They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn&rsquo;t know his name then.) I was suspicious&mdash;I thought it was another trap.

  },
  "3011": {
    "p": "&ldquo;But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house. They were all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened. Word had come that he was to be killed. I needn&rsquo;t tell the next part, because you know it. I thought I&rsquo;d have time to rush up and get the papers from their hiding-place, but I was caught. So I screamed out that he was escaping, and I said I wanted to go back to Marguerite. I shouted the name three times very loud. I knew the others would think I meant Mrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped it might make Mr. Beresford think of the picture. He&rsquo;d unhooked one the first day&mdash;that&rsquo;s what made me hesitate to trust him.&rdquo;"

There are several men watching it. When we enter that house, Mr. Brown will not draw back&mdash;he will risk all, on the chance of obtaining the spark to fire his mine.

On the eve of his departure from New York he was set upon and murdered. His body was dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent identification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately for England. None of the real Hersheimmer&rsquo;s friends or intimates saw him before he sailed&mdash;though indeed it would hardly have mattered if they had, the impersonation was so perfect. Since then he had been hand and glove with those sworn to hunt him down. Every secret of theirs has been known to him. Only once did he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew his secret. It was no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever be offered to her. But for Miss Tuppence&rsquo;s fortunate change of plan, she would have been far away from the flat when we arrived there. Exposure stared him in the face. He took a desperate step, trusting in his assumed character to avert suspicion. He nearly succeeded&mdash;but not quite.&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; murmured Jane. &ldquo;He seemed so splendid.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3046": {
    "p": "&ldquo;The real Julius Hersheimmer <em>was</em> a splendid fellow! And Mr. Brown is a consummate actor. But ask Miss Tuppence if she also has not had her suspicions.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3047": {
    "p": "Jane turned mutely to Tuppence. The latter nodded."
  },
  "3048": {
    "p": "&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to say it, Jane&mdash;I knew it would hurt you. And, after all, I couldn&rsquo;t be sure. I still don&rsquo;t understand why, if he&rsquo;s Mr. Brown, he rescued us.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3049": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?&rdquo;"
  },
  "3050": {
    "p": "Tuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the evening, ending up: &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see <em>why!</em>&rdquo;"
  },
  "3051": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a last hope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape&mdash;and the escape must be managed so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a put-up job. They&rsquo;re not averse to young Beresford&rsquo;s being in the neighbourhood, and, if necessary, communicating with you. They&rsquo;ll take care to get him out of the way at the right minute. Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic style. Bullets fly&mdash;but don&rsquo;t hit anybody. What would have happened next? You would have driven straight to the house in Soho and secured the document which Miss Finn would probably have entrusted to her cousin&rsquo;s keeping. Or, if he conducted the search, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already rifled. He would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the situation, but the result would have been the same. And I rather fancy some accident would have happened to both of you. You see, you know rather an inconvenient amount. That&rsquo;s a rough outline. I admit I was caught napping; but somebody else wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3052": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said Tuppence softly."
  },
  "3053": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him&mdash;he was too sharp for them. All the same, I&rsquo;m not too easy in my mind about him.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3054": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;"
  },
  "3055": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,&rdquo; said Sir James dryly. &ldquo;And it takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr. Brown....&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;"
  },
  "3058": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Nothing until we&rsquo;ve been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has still got the upper hand, there&rsquo;s nothing to fear. If otherwise, our enemy will come to find us, and he will not find us unprepared!&rdquo; From a drawer in the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat pocket."
  },
  "3059": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re ready. I know better than even to suggest going without you, Miss Tuppence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;I should think so indeed!&rdquo;"
  },
  "3061": {

  },
  "3063": {

    "p": "Sir James&rsquo;s car was ordered round. During the short drive Tuppence&rsquo;s heart beat tumultuously. In spite of momentary qualms of uneasiness respecting Tommy, she could not but feel exultation. They were going to win!"
  },
  "3065": {
    "p": "The car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out. Sir James went up to a plain-clothes man who was on duty with several others, and spoke to him. Then he rejoined the girls."
  },
  "3066": {
    "p": "&ldquo;No one has gone into the house so far. It is being watched at the back as well, so they are quite sure of that. Anyone who attempts to enter after we have done so will be arrested immediately. Shall we go in?&rdquo;"
  },
  "3067": {
    "p": "A policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They had also had orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member of the party was unknown to them. The three entered the house, pulling the door to behind them. Slowly they mounted the rickety stairs. At the top was the ragged curtain hiding the recess where Tommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had heard the story from Jane in her character of &ldquo;Annette.&rdquo; She looked at the tattered velvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it moved&mdash;as though <em>some one</em> was behind it. So strong was the illusion that she almost fancied she could make out the outline of a form.... Supposing Mr. Brown&mdash;Julius&mdash;was there waiting...."
  },

  },
  "3069": {
    "p": "Now they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to hide here, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided herself indignantly. She must not give way to this foolish fancying&mdash;this curious insistent feeling that <em>Mr. Brown was in the house</em>.... Hark! what was that? A stealthy footstep on the stairs? There <em>was</em> some one in the house! Absurd! She was becoming hysterical."
  },
  "3070": {
    "p": "Jane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She unhooked it with a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and festoons of cobwebs lay between it and the wall. Sir James handed her a pocket-knife, and she ripped away the brown paper from the back.... The advertisement page of a magazine fell out. Jane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed inner edges she extracted two thin sheets covered with writing!"

    "p": "No dummy this time! The real thing!"

  "3072": {
    "p": "&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; said Tuppence. &ldquo;At last....&rdquo;"
  },
  "3073": {

  },
  "3074": {
    "p": "Sir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively."
  },
  "3075": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;this is the ill-fated draft treaty!&rdquo;"
  },
  "3076": {

  },

    "p": "Sir James echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and put it away in his pocket-book, then he looked curiously round the dingy room."
  },
  "3078": {
    "p": "&ldquo;It was here that our young friend was confined for so long, was it not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A truly sinister room. You notice the absence of windows, and the thickness of the close-fitting door. Whatever took place here would never be heard by the outside world.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3079": {
    "p": "Tuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What if there <em>was</em> some one concealed in the house? Some one who might bar that door on them, and leave them to die like rats in a trap? Then she realized the absurdity of her thought. The house was surrounded by police who, if they failed to reappear, would not hesitate to break in and make a thorough search. She smiled at her own foolishness&mdash;then looked up with a start to find Sir James watching her. He gave her an emphatic little nod."
  },
  "3080": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does Miss Finn.&rdquo;"
  },
  "3081": {

  },
  "3087": {
    "p": "&ldquo;Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we had succeeded. <em>I</em> have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.&rdquo; His smile grew wider as he looked at Tuppence. &ldquo;Shall I tell you how it will be? Sooner or later the police will break in, and they will find three victims of Mr. Brown&mdash;three, not two, you understand, but fortunately the third will not be dead, only wounded, and will be able to describe the attack with a wealth of detail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So no one will think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said beneath his breath. &ldquo;<em>You!</em> I might have known.&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Ave, Cæsar! te morituri salutant</em>,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, still looking at Tommy."

It took place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer&rsquo;s orders were brief and forcible. He gave carte blanche&mdash;and when a millionaire gives carte blanche he usually gets it!"
  },

    "p": "Every delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried bottles of ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral decorations defied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far apart as May and November found themselves miraculously side by side. The list of guests was small and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken the liberty, he said, of bringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford, with him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurers, Miss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not least, as guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn."

Newspapers which had hinted at a general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced to hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among them sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their counsels. In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir James Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday&rsquo;s paper dealt appreciatively with the dead man&rsquo;s career. The exact manner of his sudden death was never made public."

Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which compromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of conspiracy in their hands, aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had contained a full and damning résumé of the whole plot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour leaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cat&rsquo;s paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly accepted. It was to be Peace, not War!"

Tuppence had performed her part faithfully. The model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled &ldquo;A tiger lily.&rdquo; It was all golds and reds and browns, and out of it rose the pure column of the girl&rsquo;s white throat, and the bronze masses of hair that crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in every eye, as she took her seat."

  },
  "3149": {

    "p": "&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to tell,&rdquo; said Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. &ldquo;I was an awful mug&mdash;right up to the time I found that photograph of Annette, and realized that she was Jane Finn. Then I remembered how persistently she had shouted out that word &lsquo;Marguerite&rsquo;&mdash;and I thought of the pictures, and&mdash;well, that&rsquo;s that. Then of course I went over the whole thing to see where I&rsquo;d made an ass of myself.&rdquo;"

    "p": "&ldquo;That business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius told me about it. On the face of it, it seemed that he or Sir James must have done the trick. But I didn&rsquo;t know which. Finding that photograph in the drawer, after that story of how it had been got from him by Inspector Brown, made me suspect Julius. Then I remembered that it was Sir James who had discovered the false Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind&mdash;and just decided to take no chances either way. I left a note for Julius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the Argentine, and I dropped Sir James&rsquo;s letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it was a genuine stunt. Then I wrote my letter to Mr. Carter and rang up Sir James. Taking him into my confidence would be the best thing either way, so I told him everything except where I believed the papers to be hidden. The way he helped me to get on the track of Tuppence and Annette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept my mind open between the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from Tuppence&mdash;and I knew!&rdquo;"

She&rsquo;d never spell her name &lsquo;Twopence,&rsquo; but anyone who&rsquo;d never seen it written might quite easily do so. Julius <em>had</em> seen it&mdash;he showed me a note of hers to him once&mdash;but <em>Sir James hadn&rsquo;t!</em> After that everything was plain sailing. I sent off Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but doubled back again. When Julius came bursting up in his car, I felt it wasn&rsquo;t part of Mr. Brown&rsquo;s plan&mdash;and that there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir James was actually caught in the act, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never believe it of him on my bare word&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;"

I threatened Julius with the revolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat that to Sir James, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t worry about us. The moment the girls were out of sight I told Julius to drive like hell for London, and as we went along I told him the whole story. We got to the Soho house in plenty of time and met Mr. Carter outside. After arranging things with him we went in and hid behind the curtain in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if they were asked, that no one had gone into the house. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;"

This book will pass into the possession of Scotland Yard, but it will never be publicly exhibited. Sir James&rsquo;s long association with the law would make it undesirable. But to you, who know the truth, I propose to read certain passages which will throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great man.&rdquo;"

For the first time I entertained the idea of taking my talents to that particular market.... Then I studied the criminal in the dock.... The man was a fool&mdash;he had been incredibly, unbelievably stupid. Even the eloquence of his counsel was hardly likely to save him. I felt an immeasurable contempt for him.... Then it occurred to me that the criminal standard was a low one. It was the wastrels, the failures, the general riff-raff of civilization who drifted into crime.... Strange that men of brains had never realized its extraordinary opportunities.... I played with the idea.... What a magnificent field&mdash;what unlimited possibilities! It made my brain reel...."

That I entered politics&mdash;say, even, that I became Prime Minister of England? What then? Was that power? Hampered at every turn by my colleagues, fettered by the democratic system of which I should be the mere figurehead! No&mdash;the power I dreamed of was absolute! An autocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtained by working outside the law. To play on the weaknesses of human nature, then on the weaknesses of nations&mdash;to get together and control a vast organization, and finally to overthrow the existing order, and rule! The thought intoxicated me...."

If I had chosen to be an actor, I should have been the greatest actor living! No disguises&mdash;no grease paint&mdash;no false beards! Personality! I put it on like a glove! When I shed it, I was myself, quiet, unobtrusive, a man like every other man. I called myself Mr. Brown.
