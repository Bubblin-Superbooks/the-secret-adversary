Tommy, let&rsquo;s be adventurers!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Tommy cheerfully. &ldquo;How do we begin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might hire us to commit crimes for them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Delightful,&rdquo; commented Tommy. &ldquo;Especially coming from a clergyman&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The moral guilt,&rdquo; Tuppence pointed out, &ldquo;would be theirs&mdash;not mine. You must admit that there&rsquo;s a difference between stealing a diamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be the least difference if you were caught!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. But I shouldn&rsquo;t be caught. I&rsquo;m so clever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Modesty always was your besetting sin,&rdquo; remarked Tommy.</p></div> </div>
