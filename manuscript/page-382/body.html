Say Jane was to cross the herring pond again, and the same thing was to happen. The submarine, the sinking ship, every one to take to the boats&mdash;and so on. Wouldn&rsquo;t that do the trick? Wouldn&rsquo;t it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it functioning again right away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it would be successful. It is unfortunate that there is no chance of the conditions repeating themselves as you suggest.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
