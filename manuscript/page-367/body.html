There must be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived. Where is Tuppence, by the way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, the fellows at the office said she&rsquo;d just gone out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an hour ago. But, say, can&rsquo;t you shed that British calm of yours, and get down to it? What on God&rsquo;s earth have you been doing all this time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re feeding here,&rdquo; replied Tommy, &ldquo;order now. It&rsquo;s going to be a long story.&rdquo;</p><p>Julius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table, summoned a hovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he turned to Tommy.</p></div> </div>
