The boy was on the look out for us, and was just a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He&rsquo;d been listening outside the door of the flat, but couldn&rsquo;t hear anything.

Albert&rsquo;s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.&rdquo; With which Julius departed abruptly.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, Miss Tuppence,&rdquo; said Sir James, &ldquo;you know this place better than I do.
