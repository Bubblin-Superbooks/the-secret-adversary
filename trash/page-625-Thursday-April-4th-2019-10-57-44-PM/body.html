<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Albert looked rather crest-fallen.</p><p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;No harm done. That butler&rsquo;s an old friend of mine&mdash;I bet he knew who I was, though he didn&rsquo;t let on. It&rsquo;s not their game to show suspicion. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve found it fairly plain sailing. They don&rsquo;t want to discourage me altogether. On the other hand, they don&rsquo;t want to make it too easy. I&rsquo;m a pawn in their game, Albert, that&rsquo;s what I am. You see, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly might suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that promising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who&rsquo;s blundered in just at the right moment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
