<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the evening, ending up: &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see why!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a last hope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape&mdash;and the escape must be managed so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a put-up job. They&rsquo;re not averse to young Beresford&rsquo;s being in the neighbourhood, and, if necessary, communicating with you. They&rsquo;ll take care to get him out of the way at the right minute. Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic style. Bullets fly&mdash;but don&rsquo;t hit anybody. What would have happened next? You would have driven straight to the house in Soho and secured the document which Miss Finn would probably have entrusted to her cousin&rsquo;s keeping.</p></div> </div>
