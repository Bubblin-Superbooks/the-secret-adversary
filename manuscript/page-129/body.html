He went into oil, and he went into steel, and he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he made Wall Street sit up!&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Then he died&mdash;last fall&mdash;and I got the dollars. Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept knocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt Jane, way out West? It worried me some. You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never make good. He wasn&rsquo;t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her down. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they&rsquo;d left a daughter&mdash;Jane&mdash;who&rsquo;d been torpedoed in the Lusitania on her way to Paris. She was saved all right, but they didn&rsquo;t seem able to hear of her over this side. I guessed they weren&rsquo;t hustling any, so I thought I&rsquo;d come along over, and speed things up.</p></div> </div>
