<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Astley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by well-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from observation from the road.</p><p>On the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the grounds. Owing to Albert&rsquo;s insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on their stomachs, thereby producing a great deal more noise than if they had stood upright. In any case, these precautions were totally unnecessary. The grounds, like those of any other private house after nightfall, seemed untenanted. Tommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog. Albert&rsquo;s fancy ran to a puma, or a tame cobra. But they reached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested.</p><p>The blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large company assembled round the table. The port was passing from hand to hand. It seemed a normal, pleasant company.</p></div> </div>
