I ran round for Sir James here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was just a mite worried about what might have happened to you.

And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along to find you. Albert&rsquo;s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.&rdquo; With which Julius departed abruptly.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, Miss Tuppence,&rdquo; said Sir James, &ldquo;you know this place better than I do.
