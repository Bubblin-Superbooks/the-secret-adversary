You&rsquo;re just as plucky as they make &lsquo;em, but I wish you&rsquo;d keep right out of this.

But that doesn&rsquo;t alter facts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, bother <em>me!</em>&rdquo; said Tuppence impatiently. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s think about what can have happened to Tommy. I&rsquo;ve written to Mr. Carter about it,&rdquo; she added, and told him the gist of her letter.</p><p>Julius nodded gravely.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s good as far as it goes. But it&rsquo;s for us to get busy and do something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; asked Tuppence, her spirits rising.</p></div> </div>
