As Annie said, servants is some one nowadays, and to be treated accordingly, and, what with her passing the word round, she won&rsquo;t find it so easy to get another.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said Tuppence thoughtfully. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>An idea was dawning in her brain. She thought a minute or two, then tapped Albert on the shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;See here, son, my brain&rsquo;s got busy. How would it be if you mentioned that you&rsquo;d got a young cousin, or a friend of yours had, that might suit the place. You get me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m there,&rdquo; said Albert instantly. &ldquo;You leave it to me, miss, and I&rsquo;ll fix the whole thing up in two ticks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some lad!&rdquo; commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval. &ldquo;You might say that the young woman could come in right away. You let me know, and if it&rsquo;s O.K. I&rsquo;ll be round to-morrow at eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
