As to salary, shall we say at the rate of three hundred a year? And an equal sum for Mr. Beresford, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Tuppence beamed upon him.</p><p>&ldquo;How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I&rsquo;ll keep beautiful accounts of our expenses all debit and credit, and the balance on the right side, and red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom. I really know how to do it when I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook hands with them, and in another minute they were descending the steps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in a whirl.</p><p>&ldquo;Tommy! Tell me at once, who is &lsquo;Mr. Carter&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Tommy murmured a name in her ear.</p></div> </div>
