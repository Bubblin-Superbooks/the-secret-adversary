<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;When the Lusitania was torpedoed, a man came up to me. I&rsquo;d noticed him more than once&mdash;and I&rsquo;d figured it out in my own mind that he was afraid of somebody or something. He asked me if I was a patriotic American, and told me he was carrying papers which were just life or death to the Allies. He asked me to take charge of them. I was to watch for an advertisement in the Times. If it didn&rsquo;t appear, I was to take them to the American Ambassador.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in my dreams sometimes.... I&rsquo;ll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers had told me to watch out. He might have been shadowed from New York, but he didn&rsquo;t think so. At first I had no suspicions, but on the boat to Holyhead I began to get uneasy.</p></div> </div>
