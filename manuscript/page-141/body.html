<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Wrong!&rdquo; Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. &ldquo;We have two distinct clues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First clue, we know one of the gang.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whittington?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;d recognize him anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said Tommy doubtfully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call that much of a clue. You don&rsquo;t know where to look for him, and it&rsquo;s about a thousand to one against your running against him by accident.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; replied Tuppence thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often noticed that once coincidences start happening they go on happening in the most extraordinary way. I dare say it&rsquo;s some natural law that we haven&rsquo;t found out. Still, as you say, we can&rsquo;t rely on that.</p></div> </div>
