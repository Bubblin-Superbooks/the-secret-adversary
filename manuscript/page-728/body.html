A mysterious knock had brought Tuppence to the door of the apartment she was sharing with the American girl. It was Julius. In his hand he held a cheque.</p><p>&ldquo;Say, Tuppence,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;will you do me a good turn? Take this, and get Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You&rsquo;re all coming to supper with me at the Savoy. See? Spare no expense. You get me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; mimicked Tuppence. &ldquo;We shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a pleasure dressing Jane. She&rsquo;s the loveliest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
