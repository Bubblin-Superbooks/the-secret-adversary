<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;One night I was whisked off to London at a moment&rsquo;s notice. They took me back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the sanatorium I felt different&mdash;as though something in me that had been buried for a long time was waking up again.</p><p>&ldquo;They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn&rsquo;t know his name then.) I was suspicious&mdash;I thought it was another trap. But he looked so honest, I could hardly believe it. However, I was careful in all I said, for I knew we could be overheard. There&rsquo;s a small hole, high up in the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house. They were all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened. Word had come that he was to be killed.</p></div> </div>
