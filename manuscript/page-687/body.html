<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I felt he&rsquo;d seen right through me, but I went on playing my part. I asked again where I was, and then went on that there was something I must remember&mdash;must remember&mdash;only for the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more distressed. He asked me my name. I said I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;that I couldn&rsquo;t remember anything at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain was awful. I screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but I managed to shriek out things in French. I don&rsquo;t know how long I could have gone on, but luckily I fainted. The last thing I heard was his voice saying: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not bluff! Anyway, a kid of her age wouldn&rsquo;t know enough.</p></div> </div>
