<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You see, I&rsquo;ve figured it out that those things of Tuppence&rsquo;s are a plant too, and she&rsquo;s no more drowned than I am. The way I reason is this: as a last chance they&rsquo;ll let Jane Finn escape in the hope that she&rsquo;s been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she thinks she&rsquo;s free she&rsquo;ll go right away to the cache. Of course it&rsquo;s an awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about them&mdash;but they&rsquo;re pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty. But if they know that the papers have been recovered by us, neither of those two girls&rsquo; lives will be worth an hour&rsquo;s purchase. I must try and get hold of Tuppence before Jane escapes.</p></div> </div>
