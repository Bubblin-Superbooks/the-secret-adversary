<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Off I go where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with nothing to do. People will wonder what I&rsquo;m up to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the city. Every one&rsquo;s in such a hurry. Probably no one will even notice you at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the second time you&rsquo;ve made that sort of remark. Never mind, I forgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are you doing this afternoon?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
