Very well, we must arrange a compromise. How would it be if you attached little Conrad here to my person. He&rsquo;s a faithful fellow, and very ready with the fist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We prefer,&rdquo; said the German coldly, &ldquo;that you should remain here.

I don&rsquo;t believe one of you has got an ounce of tact.&rdquo;</p><p>The German rapped the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Those are our terms. Otherwise, death!&rdquo;</p><p>Tommy leaned back wearily.</p></div> </div>
