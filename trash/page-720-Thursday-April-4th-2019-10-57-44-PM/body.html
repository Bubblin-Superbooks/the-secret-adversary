I am Mr. Brown....&rdquo;</p><p>Stupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of his face had changed. It was a different man who stood before them. He smiled a slow cruel smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we had succeeded. I have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.&rdquo; His smile grew wider as he looked at Tuppence. &ldquo;Shall I tell you how it will be? Sooner or later the police will break in, and they will find three victims of Mr. Brown&mdash;three, not two, you understand, but fortunately the third will not be dead, only wounded, and will be able to describe the attack with a wealth of detail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So no one will think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
