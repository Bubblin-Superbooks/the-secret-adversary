<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Very cautiously, inch by inch, I crawled along. The bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it didn&rsquo;t do to think of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where I wanted to be.</p><p>&ldquo;The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way. There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room, and sitting at that table, facing towards me, was Whittington right enough. He was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse. She was sitting with her back to me, so I couldn&rsquo;t see her face. Although the blinds were up, the window itself was shut, so I couldn&rsquo;t catch a word of what they said. Whittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse just listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she&rsquo;d shake her head, as though she were answering questions.</p></div> </div>
