<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But I&rsquo;ve loved you from the very moment I set eyes on your photo&mdash;and now I&rsquo;ve seen you I&rsquo;m simply crazy about you! If you&rsquo;ll only marry me, I won&rsquo;t worry you any&mdash;you shall take your own time. Maybe you&rsquo;ll never come to love me, and if that&rsquo;s the case I&rsquo;ll manage to set you free. But I want the right to look after you, and take care of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want,&rdquo; said the girl wistfully. &ldquo;Some one who&rsquo;ll be good to me. Oh, you don&rsquo;t know how lonesome I feel!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
