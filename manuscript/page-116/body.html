<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Buck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance. And, anyway, we&rsquo;re only starting. If we draw a blank in London, there&rsquo;s a fine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. &ldquo;And all expenses paid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen quickly. So far, adventure has succeeded adventure, but this morning has been dull as dull.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence. Remember that if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it&rsquo;s a wonder that he has not ere now done us to death. That&rsquo;s a good sentence, quite a literary flavour about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really more conceited than I am&mdash;with less excuse! Ahem! But it certainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked vengeance upon us. (You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way unscathed.&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">&ldquo;Perhaps he doesn&rsquo;t think us worth bothering</p></div> </div>
