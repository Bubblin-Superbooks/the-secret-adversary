We&rsquo;ll have to hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>Carshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence called &ldquo;ladylike looking houses.&rdquo; They rang the bell at No. 27, and a neat maid answered the door. She looked so respectable that Tuppence&rsquo;s heart sank. Upon Tommy&rsquo;s request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into a small study on the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute elapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face and a tired manner entered the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Y. A.?&rdquo; he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive. &ldquo;Do sit down, both of you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
