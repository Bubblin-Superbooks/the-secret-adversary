<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I sent off Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but doubled back again. When Julius came bursting up in his car, I felt it wasn&rsquo;t part of Mr. Brown&rsquo;s plan&mdash;and that there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir James was actually caught in the act, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never believe it of him on my bare word&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Carter ruefully.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I sent the girls off to Sir James. I was sure they&rsquo;d fetch up at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threatened Julius with the revolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat that to Sir James, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t worry about us. The moment the girls were out of sight I told Julius to drive like hell for London, and as we went along I told him the whole story.</p></div> </div>
