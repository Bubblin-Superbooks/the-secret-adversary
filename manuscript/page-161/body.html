Suddenly, in a lull in the clatter of the room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington was speaking. &ldquo;Ah, but you don&rsquo;t know Flossie. She&rsquo;s a marvel.

She gets the voice right every time, and that&rsquo;s really the principal thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Tommy did not hear Boris&rsquo;s reply, but in response to it Whittington said something that sounded like: &ldquo;Of course&mdash;only in an emergency....&rdquo;</p><p>Then he lost the thread again.
