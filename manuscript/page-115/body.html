They had collected a Gladys Mary and a Marjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and had been forced to listen to a long lecture on universal suffrage from a vivacious American lady whose Christian name had proved to be Sadie.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, &ldquo;I feel better.
