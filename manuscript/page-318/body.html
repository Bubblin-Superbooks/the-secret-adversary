<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and cry for murder out after me? If you&rsquo;ve any sense at all, you&rsquo;ll realize that poisoning you wouldn&rsquo;t suit my book at all. It&rsquo;s a sleeping draught, that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ll wake up to-morrow morning none the worse. I simply don&rsquo;t want the bother of tying you up and gagging you. That&rsquo;s the alternative&mdash;and you won&rsquo;t like it, I can tell you! I can be very rough if I choose. So drink this down like a good girl, and you&rsquo;ll be none the worse for it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
