I hope you&rsquo;re fond of motoring?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? I refuse to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get mad. You must see I&rsquo;m not such a kid as to leave you here. You&rsquo;d ring up your friends on that telephone first thing! Ah!&rdquo; He observed the fall on the other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You see, you&rsquo;d got it all fixed. No, sir, you&rsquo;re coming along with me. This your bedroom next door here? Walk right in. Little Willie and I will come behind. Put on a thick coat, that&rsquo;s right. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we&rsquo;re ready. We walk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car&rsquo;s waiting. And don&rsquo;t you forget I&rsquo;ve got you covered every inch of the way. I can shoot just as well through my coat pocket.</p></div> </div>
