If Beresford has still got the upper hand, there&rsquo;s nothing to fear. If otherwise, our enemy will come to find us, and he will not find us unprepared!&rdquo; From a drawer in the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re ready. I know better than even to suggest going without you, Miss Tuppence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should think so indeed!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be perfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with all she has been through.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
