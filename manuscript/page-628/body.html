<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had elaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure that the inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with him up to a certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a surprise.</p><p>About twelve o&rsquo;clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was told that some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant proved to be a rude-looking carter well coated with mud.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, my good fellow, what is it?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p><p>&ldquo;Might this be for you, sir?&rdquo; The carter held out a very dirty folded note, on the outside of which was written: &ldquo;Take this to the gentleman at the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you ten shillings.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
