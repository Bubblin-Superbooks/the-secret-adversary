<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">two people talking in the room. Mrs. Vandemeyer was one of them. I tried to listen, but at first I couldn&rsquo;t take much in. When at last I did begin to grasp what was going on&mdash;I was just terrified! I wonder I didn&rsquo;t scream right out there and then.</p><p>&ldquo;They hadn&rsquo;t found the papers. They&rsquo;d got the oilskin packet with the blanks, and they were just mad! They didn&rsquo;t know whether <em>I</em>&rsquo;d changed the papers, or whether Danvers had been carrying a dummy message, while the real one was sent another way. They spoke of&rdquo;&mdash;she closed her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;torturing me to find out!</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never known what fear&mdash;really sickening fear&mdash;was before! Once they came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be still unconscious, but I was afraid they&rsquo;d hear the beating of my heart. However, they went away again. I began thinking madly. What could I do? I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stand up against torture very long.</p></div> </div>
