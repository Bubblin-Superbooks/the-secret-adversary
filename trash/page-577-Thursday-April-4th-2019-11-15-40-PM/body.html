I owe you something for the relentless way you&rsquo;ve squashed me whenever I&rsquo;ve tried to be sentimental.&rdquo;</p><p>Tuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its course round the north side of Regent&rsquo;s Park.</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t really proposed now,&rdquo; pointed out Tuppence. &ldquo;Not what our grandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening to a rotten one like Julius&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m inclined to let you off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to get out of marrying me, so don&rsquo;t you think it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What fun it will be,&rdquo; responded Tuppence. &ldquo;Marriage is called all sorts of things, a haven, and a refuge, and a crowning glory, and a state of bondage, and lots more. But do you know what I think it is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
