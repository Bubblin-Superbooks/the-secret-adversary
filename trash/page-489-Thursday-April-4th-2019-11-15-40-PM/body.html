His lips were white, and his voice was not very steady:</p><p>&ldquo;It is I&mdash;Kramenin! Bring down the girl at once! There is no time to lose!&rdquo;</p><p>Whittington had come down the steps. He uttered an exclamation of astonishment at seeing the other.</p><p>&ldquo;You! What&rsquo;s up? Surely you know the plan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Kramenin interrupted him, using the words that have created many unnecessary panics:</p><p>&ldquo;We have been betrayed! Plans must be abandoned. We must save our own skins. The girl! And at once! It&rsquo;s our only chance.&rdquo;</p><p>Whittington hesitated, but for hardly a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;You have orders&mdash;from <em>him?</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Naturally!
