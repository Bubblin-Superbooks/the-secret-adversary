<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, go to the devil! I can&rsquo;t stand your coming here and talking about &lsquo;little Tuppence.&rsquo; Go and look after your cousin. Tuppence is my girl! I&rsquo;ve always loved her, from the time we played together as kids. We grew up and it was just the same. I shall never forget when I was in hospital, and she came in in that ridiculous cap and apron! It was like a miracle to see the girl I loved turn up in a nurse&rsquo;s kit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>But Julius interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;A nurse&rsquo;s kit! Gee whiz! I must be going to Colney Hatch! I could swear I&rsquo;ve seen Jane in a nurse&rsquo;s cap too. And that&rsquo;s plumb impossible! No, by gum, I&rsquo;ve got it! It was her I saw talking to Whittington at that nursing home in Bournemouth. She wasn&rsquo;t a patient there! She was a nurse!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said Tommy angrily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s probably been in with them from the start. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she stole those papers from Danvers to begin with.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
