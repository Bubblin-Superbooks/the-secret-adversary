I&rsquo;m superstitious myself. Luck, and all that sort of thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this.&rdquo;</p><p>Tommy indulged in a chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;My word! I don&rsquo;t wonder Whittington got the wind up when Tuppence plumped out that name! I should have myself. But look here, sir, we&rsquo;re taking up an awful lot of your time. Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed. You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing there is a likelihood of the pace being forced.&rdquo;</p><p>Tuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.</p></div> </div>
