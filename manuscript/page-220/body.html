Although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain a role indefinitely, she had too much common sense not to recognize the force of Mr. Carter&rsquo;s arguments.</p><p>There was still no word or message from Tommy, but the morning post brought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s O.K.&rdquo; scrawled upon it.</p></div> </div>
