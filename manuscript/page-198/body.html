Your London and South Western road.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Waterloo?&rdquo; frowned Tuppence.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Didn&rsquo;t he tell you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him either,&rdquo; replied Tuppence impatiently. &ldquo;Go on about Waterloo. What were you doing there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on, and hustle.

He pointed out the crooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy shoved a ticket into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars. He was going to sleuth the other crook.&rdquo; Julius paused. &ldquo;I thought for sure you&rsquo;d know all this.&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">&ldquo;Julius,&rdquo; said Tuppence firmly, &ldquo;stop walking up</p></div> </div>
