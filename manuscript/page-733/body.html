He came forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re my nephew, are you? Not much to look at&mdash;but you&rsquo;ve done good work, it seems. Your mother must have brought you up well after all. Shall we let bygones be bygones, eh? You&rsquo;re my heir, you know; and in future I propose to make you an allowance&mdash;and you can look upon Chalmers Park as your home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, it&rsquo;s awfully decent of you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
