<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Friday&rsquo;s my usual day, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows.</p><p>&ldquo;And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out to-day, as you only came yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion about you last night.&rdquo; Her smile broadened, catlike. &ldquo;Your request is very&mdash;typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand all this&mdash;but you can go out to-day. It makes no difference to me, as I shall not be dining at home.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
