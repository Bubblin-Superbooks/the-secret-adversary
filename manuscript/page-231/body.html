What&rsquo;s your idea?&rdquo;</p><p>Sir James considered for a moment or two.</p><p>&ldquo;There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.&rdquo; He turned to Tuppence. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night, do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she would have taken the latchkey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. I will call upon her about ten o&rsquo;clock. What time are you supposed to return?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion if you did not stay out till the usual time. Be back by nine-thirty. I will arrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait below in a taxi perhaps.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a new Rolls-Royce car,&rdquo; said Tuppence with vicarious pride.</p></div> </div>
