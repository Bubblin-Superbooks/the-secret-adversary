<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was one woman who had been very keen to look after me, and chum up with me generally&mdash;a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I&rsquo;d been only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was something about her I didn&rsquo;t like, and on the Irish boat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they looked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that she&rsquo;d been quite near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave me the packet, and before that she&rsquo;d tried to talk to him once or twice. I began to get scared, but I didn&rsquo;t quite see what to do.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to London that day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness.</p></div> </div>
