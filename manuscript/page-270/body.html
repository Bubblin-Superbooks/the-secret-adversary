<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Dr. Hall laughed. &lsquo;No. He came down to see one of my nurses, Nurse Edith, who is a niece of his.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, fancy that!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;Is he still here?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, he went back to town almost immediately.&rsquo; &lsquo;What a pity!&rsquo; I ejaculated. &lsquo;But perhaps I could speak to his niece&mdash;Nurse Edith, did you say her name was?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the doctor shook his head. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that, too, is impossible. Nurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.&rsquo; &lsquo;I seem to be real unlucky,&rsquo; I remarked. &lsquo;Have you Mr. Whittington&rsquo;s address in town? I guess I&rsquo;d like to look him up when I get back.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know his address. I can write to Nurse Edith for it if you like.&rsquo; I thanked him. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say who it is wants it. I&rsquo;d like to give him a little surprise.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
