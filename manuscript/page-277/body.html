<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; asked Tuppence, her spirits rising.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better get on the track of Boris. You say he&rsquo;s been to your place. Is he likely to come again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He might. I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see. Well, I guess I&rsquo;d better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress as a chauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you could make some kind of signal, and I&rsquo;d trail him. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Splendid, but he mightn&rsquo;t come for weeks.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
