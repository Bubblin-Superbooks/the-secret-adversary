His four days&rsquo; imprisonment had taught him anew to value good food.</p><p>He was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of Sole Ã  la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius entering the room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded in attracting the other&rsquo;s attention. At the sight of Tommy, Julius&rsquo;s eyes seemed as though they would pop out of his head. He strode across, and pump-handled Tommy&rsquo;s hand with what seemed to the latter quite unnecessary vigour.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy snakes!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Is it really you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it is. Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be? Say, man, don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;ve been given up for dead? I guess we&rsquo;d have had a solemn requiem for you in another few days.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
