The whole thing was prearranged, sham packet and all, with the object of making us think the game was up&mdash;therefore I fancy that we must have been pretty hot on the scent.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I&rsquo;ve even got an idea where the papers are. That last&rsquo;s only a guess, of course, but I&rsquo;ve a sort of feeling it&rsquo;ll turn out right. Anyhow, I enclose it in a sealed envelope for what it&rsquo;s worth.
