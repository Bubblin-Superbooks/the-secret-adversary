If we draw a blank in London, there&rsquo;s a fine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. &ldquo;And all expenses paid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen quickly. So far, adventure has succeeded adventure, but this morning has been dull as dull.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence. Remember that if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it&rsquo;s a wonder that he has not ere now done us to death. That&rsquo;s a good sentence, quite a literary flavour about it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
