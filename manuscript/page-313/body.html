<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The room was in a state of wild disorder, clothes were flung about right and left, a suit-case and a hat box, half-packed, stood in the middle of the floor.</p><p>Tuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook a little, but she spoke out bravely.</p><p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is nonsense. You can&rsquo;t shoot me. Why, every one in the building would hear the report.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d risk that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. &ldquo;But, as long as you don&rsquo;t sing out for help, you&rsquo;re all right&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think you will. You&rsquo;re a clever girl. You deceived me all right. I hadn&rsquo;t a suspicion of you! So I&rsquo;ve no doubt that you understand perfectly well that this is where I&rsquo;m on top and you&rsquo;re underneath. Now then&mdash;sit on the bed. Put your hands above your head, and if you value your life don&rsquo;t move them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
